Molly Ivins said she loves to raise
hell.

The politically charged columnist
who describes herself as “slightly left of

Lenin,” spread the word Monday night to

an enthusiastic audience in the Carnegie
Music Hall as _part of the Drue Heinz
Lecture Series.

‘Ivins is a three-time finalist for the '

Pulitzer Prize, and her column for the Fort
Worth Star—Te1egrarn is syndicated in
more than 300 newspapers. She has
received a Lifetime Achievement Award
from the National Society of Newspaper
Columnists and has written several books,

' most recently, “Shrub: the Short but‘

Happy Political Life of George W. Bush.”

 The crowded‘ Carnegie auditorium
was ﬁlled with her distinctive Texas draw]
as she spoke about America’s involve-
ment in Afghanistan, the economy and

one. of her favorite targets— the presi-

dent.

Addressing -the situation in

Shrub,’ George W. Bush

Afghanistan, Ivins said that one of the
main problems there is our allies in the
area. She likened the situation to that of a
warlord who switched sides nine times
and now has a position in. the new gov-
ernment She also referred to Osama bin
_Laden as “Osama bin, as they call him in
Texas, like Billy Bo .” -

Ivins said one of the worst things
about the Sept. 11 attacks was the missed

opportunity for conservation. People were a

ready to make great sacriﬁces for their
country, and would have been more than
willing to do thingslike cut back,on their
fossil fuel usage, but “basically Bush
asked us to go out and shop.”

She then segued into a criticism of
Bush’s_ April tax cut and~the economic
stimulus package, which she said were
greatly skewed toward corporate interests.
Ivins cited Enron Corporation as an
example of “a paradigm of what is wrong
between government and corporate
money.” ' . '

Missing meetings: some SGB members MIA

SHANNON MCLAUGHLIN
Editor in Chief

\

. , Facing a tight budget that has plagued

members all year, just two-thirds of Pitt’s

Student Government Board met Monday
night to publicly discuss spending cuts and
future programs. - " A

Board members John Algie, Carrie
Howard and Kerianne Ludwig.—- a full third

of the nine person Board including President

Jeff Alex.— were each absent without excuse,
according to Alex. V

“I was disappointed on the attendance,”
he said. ‘I I ; _

. According to Article VII of the SGB
Constitution, once .a‘ Board. member has
missed four meetings without an excuse, he or
she may be dismissed fromofﬁce by a two-
thirds majority Boardvote. .

Alex said he has accepted reasons ranging
from exams and papers to family issues as
excuses from the weekly meeting. Alex him-
self missed one meeting this year for a family
vacation. In fact, every Board member except
Kevin Washo has had at least one excused
absence during his or her tenure, according to
Alex. .

Monday’s absences are the ﬁrst offense
for Algie and Ludwig, but it was the second
time this year that Howard has been missing
without an excuse. Howard was not available
for comment at press time last night. A

Despite just barely making the quorum of

five Board members in addition to Alex, SGB
discussed plans to change spending habits in
the new ﬁscal year. The board entertained
suggestions resulting from surveys that

_ Allocations Chair Jen Kolenda distributed to

student organizations.

According to Alex, budgetary cuts are
necessary this year because his board began
its tenure without much money in the bank.

' Alex said that normally between $60,000 and

$80,000 of SGB’s annual budget of approxi-
mately. $860,000 is left over at the end of each
year. However, this year Alex said there was
approximately $15,000 left over. This is a
result, he said, of liberal allocating by the last
two boards. He concluded later, however, that
this year’s allocations committee is the best
he’s seen in years, noting that it’s the ﬁrst year
the committee has not had a “major” dis-
agreement with the board.  I‘

The board voted in favor of funding com-
petitions for intercollegiate club sports teams.
In the past, according to Alex, teams were
only funded for materials needed to function
as a team. With the new bylaw, intercollegiate
club teams will now be ableto request up to
$2000, the equivalent of one competitive pro-
gram. ’ I

“We would like to helpthem out as much
as we can,” Alex said, noting that these teams

will still need to fundraise tomake upa sub--

stantial portion of their costs.

ruptcy scandal as “ﬁnancializing markets” which involved
“ﬁnding a regulatory black hole and taking advantage of emerg-
ing markets.” But Ivins admitted that she could be wrong about
the alleged ﬁnancial misconduct. '

“My math is not that goodj I’m a product of Texas public
schools,” she said. ' . 

Ivins continued by pointing out the folly of the government
violating the civil rights of many Arab-Americans since Sept. 11.

“Who will inﬁltrate al Qaeda? It is not going to be blue-eyed
blonde haired boys from Texas. We need Arab-Americans,” she
said.

. “These are the people that fought Saddam Hussein . .. they
have the language, culture and motivation. It is our stupidity and
fear to rnistreat them and it is terribly sad.”

Ivins reminded the audience, “The Constitution was written
by a bunch of guys who had just been through a long war,’f and
civil liberties aren’t just for times when everything isigomgiiweﬂ.

BUCKLEY AMENDMENT

The Federal Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, commonly called the “Buckley Amendment‘, is designed to protect
the privacy of students. it requires the University to comply with the following principles:

\

‘ Student records are open for inspection by students upon request. Speciﬁc documents which students have
waived their right to inspect remain conﬁdential. ,

' Students have a right to challenge the accuracy of records and to request that they be amended.

* The institution maynot release student records outside the institution without student consent, unless one of
several exceptions applies. .

' Requests from outside the institution for information regarding students should be documented, as should
releases of student infonnation. i

* Students have the right to ﬁle a complaint with the US Department of Education concerning alleged failures by
the University to comply with the requirements of the Buckley Amendment. .

* Students have a right to obtain a copy of the University policy regarding the Buckley Amendment. it may be
obtained in 220 Thackeray Hall.

’ The University may establish categories of infomration known as “Directory lnfonnation" and release this
infonnation without student consent, upon request by individuals external to the institution. Students may
request that the categories below be excluded from “Directory Information” that would be released without
student consent, upon request by a third party.

Directory information includes the following infonnation:

Nane
. Address

Phone number and electronic mail address

Major ﬁeld of study A

funher disclosures are made without that students written consent (except to parties who have legal access to student
records without written consent). Rescinding of this action can be done by the student submitting the request in writing to.
the Ofﬁce of the University Registrar. Note that the following procedures apply:

09-08-01.
3. As set forth in University Policy 09-08-01, access to students education records may be required and

permitted by University faculty and staff for legitimate educational purposes where access by such in-
dividuals is necessary to complete their University-related duties.

SGB to hold emerergency meeting

SGB, page 2

_ The last two items of discussion
concerned budget cuts, and were
tabled until an emergency meeting
that will be held this week. Alex
predicted a Thursday or Friday ses-
sion. .. a

Board members disagreed on
the suggestion that it limit off-cam-
pus retreats to‘ SGB alone.

“I don’t think it’s fair,” Michelle
Agostini said.

Heidi Busche agreed, but
Kolenda said that it was a waste of
money to fund groups to go away,
where members often “drink in
hotel rooms and party the weekend
away.” A

Alex and Kolenda agreed that
almost every other governance
group on campus funds its own
retreats privately, but Agostini per’-
sisted. is a up

“I feel personally that it’s very
hypocritica ,” she said.

Lonny Fish also agreed that the
retreats should either be kept, or cut,
for all groups.-

The board will resume discus-
sion on this topic at its emergency
meeting, as well as discussion on
whether or not governance groups
should be limited in how many con-

ferences they may attend — and
how many members they may bring
with them.

The proposed change would
limit groups‘ to two conferences
each year with four members
attending each conference.

At the meeting, Alex said -he
feels conference privileges have
been “abused,” as some groups have,
sent nearly 20 members on trips.

However, Agostini and Meghan
Fetzer both said that they’d rather
see a different route in cutting down
on these privileges. A

Fetzer suggested letting groups ‘

take three trips, with three members

.attending each. Technology com-

mittee chair Jake Repanshek sug-
gested giving groups a 10-person

cap and allowing them to make their ‘

own decisions .about——- how many.
people to send on conferences
throughout the year.

I With so much dissension, board. A
' members also. voted to table this

discussion until the {emergency
meeting that had already been

"planned.

. Changes must be voted on this
week to ensure that new allocations
manuals are distributed to student
groups in time for the annual bud-.
geting process, according to Alex.

had been inside.

“They were in our apartment,” she
said. “There were leaves all over my
bathroom and they had spilled beer on
the couch.” She also said that one of
the menhad dropped a pizza box just
inside the window.

Pitt police Chief Tim Delaney said
officers investigating the incident
talked to the residents of the apart-
ment above Bachalis’, who confirmed
arguing with some men outside.
Delaney felt certain the incident was
not a burglary.

“Burglars don’t bring in food,” he
said. “They didn’t take anything, they
just left some food.”

Bachalis expressed concern that
the responding officers didn’t dust the
living room window that the men like-
ly climbed through for fingerprints.

But Delaney said the decision to dust '

for prints depends in large part on the
police’s ability to find the perpetra-
tors. V 2

. “The solvability of this [case is]
almost nil,” he said, explaining that if

‘the police don’t have a suspect or a
record of the prints, dusting won’t q

what they took,” he said. “In this case
they didn’t take anything, they just left
food.”

The incident with the intruders, as
well as the more recent one in which
Bane’s telephone handset was stolen,
concern Bane and Bachalis because of
the ease with which the burglars
entered the apartment.

.  According to Bachalis, as recently
as this..weekend there was nothing pre-
venting residents of the apartment
from opening the living room, as well
as some of the bedroom windows, all
the way.

“Some of the windows have these

 

ﬂimsy plastic guards on them,” she
said, “but some don’t have anything.”

But yesterday, Bachalis said,
property management installed more
heavy—duty guards on all the windows
in the apartment.

Bane’s room in particular is off
the beaten path. Her window is in a
cubby of the building, her view faces
another window, and the area would
not be visible even to someone who
was very nearby. ‘ .

Delaney stressed that. the police
are doing all they can to keep the area
behind building Asafe; He said that
Pitt police patrol Oakland Avenue and

South Bouquet Streets regularly, a
pedestrian or bicycle ofﬁcer patrols
from Bouquet Gardens to the L Lot at
the corner of Oakland Avenue and
Sennott Street, and security guards
work in the Bouquet Gardens complex
from 3 p.m. until 7 a.m.

“It’s a heavy coverage area,” he
said. “A majority of the time the peo-

ple we see belong or are visitors of '

people who belong.”
While Bane is grateful for the

security and protection, she wonders

what more can be done.

“They’ve said, ‘we patrol,’ but

they can’t be everywhere,” she said.

SGB shouldn’t adopt budget cuts

The news has been ﬁlled with reports
of budget deﬁcits and expected cuts by state
and federal governments in the wake of the
current recession.

Unfortunately, Pitt’s Student
Government Board has found it has the
same problems — but not for the ‘same rea-
sons.

Typically, each board will leave a sur-
plus for the next board. But the last two, led
by Joan Snyder and Mike Unangst, respec-
tively, left the current one with almost no
rollover surplus.

The board has been consistently frugal
with allocations requests already, but that
hasn’t helped alleviate its budget cnmch.

Later this week,» SGB will host an __

emergency public meeting to iron out the
latest cuts.

Proposed cuts being discussed divide
into two areas: retreats and conferences. The

current proposal recommends limiting off- -

campus retreat ftmding to SGB. This is
ridiculous. The only other governance
group that requests ftmding for off-campus
retreats is the National Panhellenic Council.
So restricting retreats for other groups will
have little effect on the budget — and is
hypocritical. Why does SGB insist that it is
the only group that should take a retreat?
Conference attendance is also under the
microscope. The current proposal would
allow governance groups to bring four peo-
ple to two conferences every year. Even
more importantly, the only governance

group allowed to go on oﬁ-campus retreats
would be SGB itself. .

While the goal of_ preventing abuse of
these funds is laudable ——- some groups
have abused their privilege to attend confer-
ences — SGB’-s plan goes too far.

Conferences can be important times for
groups to gain inspiration for their activities
and make contacts. '

An alternative proposal raised by tech-
nology committee chair Jake Repanshek at
Monday’s board meeting is to allow each
governance group to send 10 people to con-
ferences per year. Under this plan, 10 peo-
ple could go to one conference, one person
to 10 conferences or any combination in-
between. -

This proposal makes much more sense,
as it both prevents abuse — after all, the
money being spent is our student activity
fee —— and allows groups to continue attend-
ing conferences more effectively. SGB
should reject the other proposal and approve
this one.

The money SGB is considering saving

. or spending is our activities fee. But we

can’t exercise any inﬂuence unless we
attend meetings. Every emergency meeting
must be armounced at least 24 hours in
advance, so if you want to attend the one
later this week, call the SGB olﬁce at 648-
7970 ‘or stop up at the sixth ﬂoor of the
William Pitt Union to ﬁnd out when it is.
And don’t forget, SGB also holds a
public meeting every Monday night at 8:30.

Only  02 more days to go...

Usually the first week of January
finds me sifting through racks of
cheesy landscape scenes, buxom
women draped across various
chrome—laden vehicles and enlarged
photos of dogs dressed up as humans
in search of one thing — a calendar.

Last year, my calendar was pur-
chased in Galway, Ireland. It was a
strictly for-charity affair, with very
classy black and white
photos. Of naked
Irishmen carrying vari-
ous ridiculous objects in
front of their naughty
bits. '

So maybe it’s-the

Things to do before graduating from Pitt

0 Go to a Pitt basketball game.
Somehow, despite never ‘having
missed a Pitt football game for which
I was in town (and often traveling

, hours to catch them while out of

town), I’ve never seen a game at the
Fitzgerald Field House. A spring
term in Ireland and a previous lack of
basic basketball knowledge have
kept me away in the past, but I hear
those Oakland Zoo kids are shaking
things up and I’m determined to get
with the program this season.

0 Volunteer. I’ve been promising
I’ll go help walk dogs or cuddle kit-
tens or pack food bank boxes for four
years now. It’s probably time for me
to get around to it.

0 Read. Despite this being a uni-
versity,'I find I really ought to be
reading more. I read magazines and
journals and the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette, but rarely do I read a text-
book with the same fervor. Even my

Lit texts are usually read in less than

a day, under extreme strain of exam
deadline.

0 Lay on the Lawn. When you
get right down to it, I really don’t
want to go to class, I really don’t
want to write papers and I really

No Doubt sets the beat
with a party album

Rock Steady
No Doubt

Interscope‘ Records
vﬁikﬁ

BRIAN PALMER
Staff Writer

After providing a strong founda-
tion with Tragic Kingdom in 1995
and then proving that they
can make statements with

A 0
songs of substance in their 

2000 release of Return of
Saturn, No Doubt went
back to their dancehall roots with
their 2001 release of Rock Steady.
After making serious statements
about being oppressed as a woman,
Gwen Stefani and the rest of the
band felt the need to let loose and
party.

The Interscope Records release
of the made—to—party CD comes
quickly considering that No Doubt

spent five years working on Saturn.
The band used several different pro-
ducers while making this album,
including former Cars frontman Ric
Ocasek on “Don’t Let Me Down”
and -“Platinum Blonde Life,” as well
as Prince, who co-produced and
sings backup on the beautiful
“Waiting Room.”

Rock Steady provides the feel for
the need to party beginning with the
first song onrthe CD, “Hella Good,”
which, mixed with the ska and reg-
gae dance sound, could make a per-
fect dance party song, along with
most of the tracks on Saturn.

The band also did
something on this album
that they have never done
before — having guest
. vocalists sing on their
tracks. Along with the assistance
from Prince, the band also called on
a couple of well-established reggae
singers in. Bounty Killer, who help
on the hit single “Hey Baby,” and
Lady Saw, who adds her talent to
another smooth and beautiful song
called “Underneath It All.”

The band adds a new ﬂavor to

-this album that has never really been

present in previous albums, but still
keeps with the traditional smooth
rock songs that accentuate Gwen’s
unique and beautiful vocals. The
band, while keeping the pace, of the
tracks “rocks steady” so to speak,
and provides the listener with the
party vibe. They also keep their pre-

   


viousstyle of singing about relation-
ships through a number of songs on
the «disc.

Gwen sings, ‘‘A performance
deserving a standing ovation,” in the
opening track of “Hella Good” and
she’s right. This album deserves a
standing ovation indeed.

If the sunny summertime owned a

perhaps called the Astro Lounge,
would be open 24 hours a day and the

Unfortunately for Mr.
Summertime, there is no SoCal club
and Smash Mouth probably won’t be
doing any daylong shows. Well within
the parameters of reality, however, is
the new Smash Mouth album, simply
titled Smash Mouth. Like its predeces-
sors, it provides planet Earth with
happy pop rock at its ﬁnest. .
Sticking to what worked for them
in the past, Smash Mouth went back to

helping

AmericaniPie 2: the DVD

Universal
ikikik

The sequel to “American Pie,”
appropriately titled, “American Pie
2,” not only defies’ the logic of
sequels to teen movies being bombs,
but it also tops the original with new
and challenging story lines, and takes
a step up from the physical c‘_omedy
present in the original “Pie.”

Now, with yesterday’s release of
the “American Pie 2” DVD, you can
watch your favorite scenes over and
over in the comfort and privacy of
your own home. ., p

The movie in itself is based a
year later from the original movie,

and is the first summer that the gang ‘

will spend together after their first

V full year of college. The cast from the

original has returned to face the chal-
lenge, of how they c_an have a “super
summer.” ' A

The DVD is of very good quality,
and uses full screen picture instead of
pesky wide screen as well as Dolby
digital and DTS surround sound. If
you are ﬂuent in the language, you
can also watch in French.

The bonus features of the DVD
add a few extra hours of laughs that
you just-simply couldn’t get at the
theater. ‘

Included in the special features is

‘ a “making of the movie” feature that

is about 30 minutes long, as well as
the trailer of the movie with a public
service announcement from Jason
Biggs.

The DVD also includes “never
before seen” behind-the-scenes

footage with the cast and crew, which
provides a decent amount of extra
laughs, as well as a classic movie
lines section. You click on the line
you would like to re-hear and it takes
you to the scene. A. '

Another feature that is a good
laugh is a Top 10 list of viewers’
favorite scenes from both “Pie”
movies, with the lesbian scene from
Pie 2 at the No. 1 spot.

Also included is a film produc-
tion notes section as well as filmmak-
ers andstar bios.

The music~aspect of the film is
captured in the DVD with the video
for 3 Doors Down “Be Like That,” as
well as the opportunity to go to par-
ticular scenes from “the film to listen
to your favorite song that appeared in
the movie.

The DVD also includes commen-
taries. You have the choice of watch-
ing the movie with commentaries
from an informational standpoint, i.e.
from the director, J .B. Rogers, or
from writer Adam Herz, or you can
watch from the comical standpoint of
actors by either watching the com-
mentary of. Jason Biggs, Thomas Ian
Nicholas and Mena Suvari, or the
solo commentary by Eddie Kaye
Thomas.

The DVD also includes deleted
scenes, which for the most part were
deleted for a reason; many of the

scenes would have made the movie A

longer and would have hampered the
film’s comedic value. The most hilar-
ious aspect of the bonus features
would definitely have to be the out-
takes. Around 5 minutes in length, it
contains non—stop laughter through-
out. . J
This DVD is definitely one for
the collection and quite possibly one
that will never grow old.

“The Fast and the ;;_Furious,” this summer’s

surprise moneymaker; doesn’t lose‘ any speed as
it races its;;way into ho.rng_‘DVD collections. All"

the things‘"thatlIIi]ade  ,‘“"Fa'st and the Furious”
such a thrill ride in.-athev..th;eaters translate perfect-
ly onto the DVD. . ':' 2' _ 7;
Every time a turbo;b,utton is pushed, you ‘will
be pinned back i'nto,',your seats. The sounds of
screeching tires burning rubber and the rumbling

of souped-up engines will shake the inside of
your_homes, just like it did in the theaters.
Though “The Fast and Furious” is a fun
movie, chances have it that if you’re buying the
collector’s DVD you already liked the movie, so
the real attractions are the special features — and
these features go from zero to 60 in five flat.‘
Along with the normal deleted scenes and
directors’ commentary, Universal, the film’s stu-
dio, _.jam-packed this DVD with more twists and
turnsthan you can imagine — in this case more
is_better: viewing the last action sequence with
eight different camera angles is a film lover’s
dream.  5  3 '
Warning: for~—;t,ho_s_e: of you who don’t like to
knowfa ‘magician-”,s3.-A "secrets, the visual effects
montage isn"t forfyou. -But ‘if you’re like me, the

mix of the visual effects montage mixed with the

» special effects options provides a great insight

into the movie—making process. ,

«~ Find out where blue screens were used, what
stunts were real and what were computer‘ gener-
ated —- it might surprise you. .

See the story boards of the major action
scenes intercut with the actual scenes —- always
one of my favorite features, and if that’s not
enough, the DVD includes three music videos: Ja
Rule’s “Furious,” Cadillac _Tah’s “POV City
Anthem” and Saliva’s “Click Click Boom.”

Though companies usually jam useless and
boring features into their DVDs, this collector’s
edition is full with hours of great features —.— and
the movie is pretty good, too.

Not the butler

Gosford Park

Starring Kristin Scott Thomas,
Clive Owen, Ryan Phillippe,
Eileen Atkins, Michael Gambon
Directed by Robert Altman
'7i‘r7ﬁ'7,‘r

I’m not a big fan of ensemble
pieces or ﬁlms with five or more lead
characters. I’m also not a big fan of
character—driven movies, because I
find they lack plot. Butt “Gosford
Park” may cause me to change these
views.

Somehow “Gosford Park” man-
ages to make a character-driven movie
with fine narration; it comes in the
form of a murder mystery. To me,
Hollywood ensemble pieces tend to be
more about the stars than the charac-
ters they play. “Gosford Park,” though,
manages to place well—developed char-
acters in this format.

Director Robert Altman credits

 

THE Prrr NEWS

this phenomenon to his mostly British
cast; Ryan Phillippe (“Cruel
Intentions”) is the only young
American star in the movie.

“Sir William McCordle is loved by
some and hated by most. The time is
November 1932, and Sir McCordle has
invited guests to a shooting party, the
beginning of most murder mysteries, a
la “Clue.” But instead of showing the
murder first and then asking the ques-
tion “who did it?” second, we spend
the ﬁrst half of the movie just moving
through the worlds of the characters.

The fact that the movie’s mystery
plot does seem to force the narration is
ingenuous and the web of relationships
between characters is so elaborate that
I wondered why everyone wasn’t dead.
It’s nice to see a movie in which a plot
can exist so smoothly with its charac-
ters’ development.

Though “the butler did it” may be
the common response in murder mys-
teries, that’s not as simple as it sounds
— more than thirty servants appear in
this movie, and it doesn’t stop there.

 

The servants are the keyholes that
allow us to peek into the world of the
aristocrats. The servants help the view-
ers become Voyeurs. This movie seems
to be fixated on the aristocrats,,..though
that’s the ﬁlmmaker’s deception. The
aristocrats are very dull, but of course
the servants don’t see them this way,
and that’s where the deception lies.
The movie’s true focus is this hidden
world that exists underneath; because
it is the servants who create the excite-
ment.

I’m often reminded of the usual
ending in most Hollywood mystery
movies, where the killer is a character
that you never saw during the entire
movie, or if you did he didn’t say a
word. I can “remember a bad taste in
my mouth after leaving those types of
ﬁlms. ‘ _

But now I see the importance of all
those lackluster movies: without them
I would never have seen the beauty of
the little things that make up “Gosford
Park.” . .

Mouth, page 12

it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. A .
The only difference, although
barely noticeable, is the departure of
KeVin‘Coleman, the group’s original
drummer. New drummer Michael
Urbano keeps the “new” Smash
Mouth’s sound just as true to their elec-
tronic Beach Boy sounds of the past. _
From front to back, Smash Mouth
plays like its first single, the smooth,
up-tempo “Pacific Coast Party.”
Bouncing along like an old jalopy, the
album serves up the same /looping
beats and throwback sounds that Astro
Lounge offered. It adds a few token
slow songs on the end, similar to
‘Lounge’s “Stoned” and “Fallen
Horses.” '
Just like last time, the ﬁnal track is

-a-proven soundtrack hit. Previously, it

was “Can’t Hardly Wait’s” “Can’t Get
Enough of You Baby,” now it’s
“Shrek’s” “I’m A Believer.”

Not much has changed for Smash ‘

Mouth, but their genre and style don’t
really, call for it. The message was
clear from day one: It’s all just one big

Working overtime in Miami

KAREN BIELAK
Assistant Sports Editor

Going into last night’s men’s basket-
ball matchup, the Miami Hurricanes were
8-0 at home while the Pitt Panthers were 3-
0 on the road. Both teams also entered the
contest at 15-2. 1

Something had to give — and it did.

The teams battled into double over-
time as the No. 20 Hunicanes emerged
with a 76-69 victory over the Panthers at
Miami Arena. '

With two minutes remaining in regula-
tion, Miarni’s Marcus Barnes hit a three-
pointer to tie the game at 58. Ontario Lett
answered back to regain the lead for the
Panthers but James Jones once again
brought the Hurricanes back to even the
score. VV1th' 8.1 seconds left on the clock
and the Hurricanes holding possession,
Miami called a timeout as a pass was being
made than would have resulted in a basket

But when the teams returned to the
court, Miami made an errant pass that
rolled to the other end of the court but no
Pitt players could get a handle on it and the
teams went into overtime tied at 60.

The Panthers struck ﬁrst with two free
throws and a basket from Lett. A foul on
Brandin Knight at the 3:04 mark sent
Barnes to the line where he hit both shots

WES BRYANT/PHOTO EDITOR

Ontario Lett’s 18 points weren’t enough to carry the Panthers to victory over
the Miami Hurricanes last night, as they lost 76-69 in double overtime. ’

to pull the Hurricanes within two. With
1:42 remaining, Jones went to the line and
also hit two shots to tie the game once
again.

After exchanging free throw shots,
Donatas Zavackas missed an open three-
pointer than,would have given the Panthers

the lead with just seconds remaining. Pitt
and Miami were tiedat 65 when a foil] was
called on Julius Page with 1.3 seconds left
on the clock, sending Barnes to the line.
But Barnes missed both of his chances

Women’s basketballfalls to Rutgers

KEVIN NASH AND KAREN BIELAK
Staff Report

The women’s basketball team has been struggling in the wins
column, but Haley Harguth is having no trouble ﬁnding, the net.

The ﬁeshman scored a season- and career-high 22 points in the
Panthers’ 82-70 loss at Rutgers last night, breaking her previous high
of 21 set last game against Boston College.

Harguth saw 29 minutes of action off the bench and has played
a key role for Pitt since forwards Mandy VV1ttenmyer and Sheila
Stuﬂlet went down with injuries in recent contests. Harguth’s seven
three-pointers against the Scarlet Knights also ties her high against
the Eagles. _

Junior guard Laine Selwyn picked up the double-double with 16
points and 10 assists while Bettina Love and Brooke Stewart each
added 11 points. Love grabbed a game-high seven boards while
Selwyn connected on all eight of her attempts from the charity stripe.

Guard Nikki Jett led Rutgers in scoring with a game-high 24
points while handing out a team-high seven assists. Davalyn
Cunningham added 13 while Chelsea Newton put in 11.

Rutgers took a 42-30 lead at the half as they were able to make
half of their ﬁeld goal attempts, including three of ﬁve from behind
the arc. The Panthers made 11 out of 24 ﬁeld goal attempts, but only
connected on four of 10 three-point shots.

In the second half, Rutgers’ three point shooting tailed off as it
was only able to make four of ten from three point land. Rutgers also
dropped off in its ﬁeld goal percentage, going 11 for 29 but connect-

if .
WES BRYANT/PHOTO EDITOR

Junior guard Laine Selwyn recorded a double-double with ,

16 points and 10 assists. ‘
ing on 14 of 15 ﬁee throws. Despite matching the Scarlet  in

points in the second half, Pitt was not able to overcome the large

deﬁcit it faced at halﬁime.

The loss drops the Panthers to 6-10 overall and 1-4 in the Big
East while the Scarlet Knights improve to 5-10 and 2-3 in the con-
ference. ‘

The Panthers will look to rebounds as they travel to West
Vnginia to face the Mountaineers on Saturday.’Tip-oﬁ‘ is scheduled
for 2 p.m.

  

And so I
ask  what?

 

Spams Vlaw

Karen Bielak

I have ofﬁcially been introduced to
the World Wrestling Federation, and I
have to admit, I kind of like it.

Monday night, I went home feeling

miserably ill, so I made a cup of hot tea_
' and plopped down on the sofa in my cow

pajamas. My roommate Mario was
watching the WWF and for some reason
— perhaps the inﬂuence of medication
— I decided to give it a try.

I’ve. never been interested I in
wrestling and always thought that the
WWF was dumb, especially when guys
tried to justify that it is like a soap ‘opera
because I don’t care for soap operas,
either.

But the more that I tried to convince
myself that it was stupid and a waste of
my time, the more I found myself being
sucked" in. ‘

I didn’t understand most of what was
going on, but Mario tried his best to
explain to me although some of it just
didn’t make sense.

As I watched these guys kick, punch,
slam and jump on each other all over the

‘ ring, my ﬁrst question was, “Don’t these

guys ever get hurt?”
I have a feeling that if someone
slammed my face into the ﬂoor, I might

end up with a broken cheekbone and a fat 1

hp. ,

I began picking up on what was
going on, and then. they decided to con-
fuse me by having four guys in the ring at

once. I ﬁnally caught onto the whole-

“tagging someone else to switch places
with them” concept — deﬁnitely a good
idea for the guys getting the you-know-
what beat out of them.

I’m not exactly sure why I was so
intrigued by this barbaric “soap opera”
taking place, but perhaps it’s just my
nature. I’m the kind of person who goes
to a hockey game hoping to see a good

from the charity stripe to send the teams
into a second overtime.

But the Panthers broke down and over
the next ﬁve minutes were outscored by the

‘ Hurricanes 11-4. Miami’s John Salmons,

who at six-foot-seven-inches is the tallest
point guard in the Big East, scored the ﬁrst
basket to put the Hurricanes up 67-65.
Barnes later redeemed his earlier misses at
the free throw line by nailing a shot from
behind the are that put Miami up 70-66.
“With 1:50 left on the clock, Lett hit one
of two free throw shots to pull the Panthers
within three. But on their next possession,
Zavackas was called for traveling at the
1:04/mark, committing a costly turnover.
‘They pressured us and we didn’t do a
good job of staying on balance,” said Pitt
head coach Ben Howland in his post-game

. radio interview.

Maybe it’s   not
so bad after all

-Column, page 14

ﬁght.

When Stone Cold Steve Austin came
out, Mario clued me in to why he always
says “What?” I

This really bothered me because not
only did he constantly repeat it, but the
audience said it what seemed to be more
than a hundred times while Stone Cold
told a 20-minute story about why he was
drinking to get atbeer gut.“

What? . '

It may have been cute the ﬁrst few

1 times, but there was deﬁnitely the factor

of overkill.

What?

Is this getting annoying yet?

What?

OK, I can’t force myself to carry this
on any longer, just as I couldn’t force
myself to watch the rest of the show.

. I retreated to my room but when I
returned downstairs for yet another cup
of tea, I actually asked who had won the
ﬁnal match.

I was disappointed to ﬁnd out that
there hadn’t been one. .

I’m not going to say that I’m now a
huge WWF fan or that it’s my favorite
sport, if you can even call it that. -

‘ But I’m glad I ﬁnally gave it a
chance, because I guess it’s not that bad
after all.

’ What?

Karen Bielak is the assistant sports editor

, of The Pitt News and is afraid that she

doesn’t get oﬁf the medication soon, she
might start liking golf too. “

VV1th 17 seconds left, an injured
Knight missed a huge three-point shot that
would have once again tied the game as
Miami went on to capture the victory.

The Panthers committed a season-high
24 turnovers and squandered a 36-29 half-
time lead, the ﬁrst time this season that Pitt
has lost when leading at the half.

Knight, who is bothered by an ankle
injury, was held to a season-low ﬁve points
but did dish out 11 assists while grabbing
eight boards.

The Panthers were led in scoring by
Lett with 18, followed by Zavackas with
16 points. Page added 13.

‘For the Hurricanes, Salmons put in a

Pitt squanders halftime lead with turnovers

game-high 25 points while picking up
eight rebounds. The Hurricanes had three
other players in double digits, including
Elton Tyler with 15.

E The Panthers entered the game hitting
just 58 percent of their free throw shots, for
which they are ranked 13th in the Big East.
But Pitt hit 15 of 18 shots in the game, with
all three misses coming in overtime.

The Panthers led by as many as 11
when Zavackas hit a three-pointer early on
in the second half. Miami was experienc-
ing offensive frustration but managed to
creep back into the game by changing its
defense from man-to-man to zone defense
and the Panthers did not respond.

“We had chances but we let them
come back when we were up 11,”
Howland said. “We took bad shots that
were ill-advised.”

The Panthers have now suffered con-
secutive losses for the ﬁrst time this season
and fall to 15-3 overall and 3-2,in the Big
East. Miami improves to 16-2 overall and
3-2 in the conference.

Pitt’s upcoming schedule does not get
any easier as the Panthers must now travel
to Georgetown to take on the Hoyas
Saturday afternoon.

“How we bounce back is important,”
Howland said. “We have to show up and
get it done.”
