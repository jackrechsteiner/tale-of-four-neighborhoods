Best place to study:
Hillman Library
Runner-up:Alum‘ni Hall

You raved at Matrix on Saturday night and had the time
of your life. How _can you ever top that? There’s a well-
known place on Pitt campus that provides volmnes of enter-
tainment That magical place, as you’re probably wonder-
ing, is “Club Hillman” — otherwise known as Hillman
Library. *

Okay, so there aren’t any disco balls, and Daft Punk
music isn’t playing, but who cares? You can still get your
groove on by looking up a book on PI'IT Cat, the library’s
online book catalog, or by satisfying your thirst at the Cup
and Chaucer, Hillman’s very own mini-Starbucks Coifee
Shop.

Oh yeah,/Hillman also has 200—some computersand
about a million books, whatever they are.

Best place to hook up:
your room
Runners-up: Frat party and Hillman Library

You might have thought the Cathedral Lawn was the
best To others, the ground beneath the Panther couldn’t be
more tempting. The most ambitious of you might have even ‘
dreamed of using the Darlington Memorial Library on the
sixth ﬂoor of the Cathedral. ‘ ' P

But the Pitt police oﬁicers set you straight, so you decide
ed that your room is the best place to hook up. Although it’s
not as exciting as any public facility, you’re less likely to be
disturbed. You won’t have as much luck meeting someone
new in your room, but once you’ve nabbed the chosen one,
you’re ready_to take the lucky person back to your lair for
some private time. The Pitt police will thank you for your
responsible decision.

Just make sure to clear out the roommates ﬁrst.

Best place to take a walk:
Schenley Park

A scenic stroll along Fifth Avenue can be pleasant —
until a bus passes by, splashes you and spews exhaust

When you tire of taking nature hikes on cement side-
walks, Schenley Park is there for you. VV1th winding trails
through the woods, it’s easy to escape from your troubles, as
well as from the less pleasant’ aspects of city life.

You don’t have to go to Schenley Park by yourself to
enjoy the tranquil atmosphere. A large stone bridge on one
of the trails is excellent for playing ‘The Three Billy Goats
Gruﬂ” wiﬂi three of your friends — depending on your
mood, it might relieve you to play the troll.

Schenley Park is also equipped with tennis courts, a

track, an ice skating rink and several playgrounds dispersed .

throughout the park to distract you from your walk.

So next time you want to stretch your legs, you can stay
dry, breaﬂie easily, and take a/walk in Schenley Park;

Best place to nap:
your bed
Runner-up: Cathedral Lawn

Though Forbes Avenue is signifi-
cantly more spacious, your bed is a
much better place to nap because: 1. It is
softer, and 2. There are generally fewer
cars in your bed.

Likely, you have been going to class
only to try to get a date with the person
three desks up the row, and would rather
take a nap in his or her bed. But she will
probably not let you, and if she did, you
would be a fool to nap.

According to Pitt legend, those who
decide to nap in the Grand Lounge

Room in the William Pitt Union will

always wake up on time for classes. But
when you have an exam or a paper to
turn in, your alarm clock is more trust-
worthy than providence. Also, while the
room is undergoing changes, the soft,
velvety, red couches and chairs have
been removed, along with the carpet, to
reveal bare tile ﬂooring.

Also, napping in public puts you in
danger of drooling on yourself in front

of friends or having your stuff stolen. ‘

Not to mention that your snuggle bear
may earn you ridicule.

So your best bet for a nap, whether
you live in a dorm, a house or an apart-
ment, is your own bed, with your own
stuffed animals. '
— Marty F laherty, Copy Chief

Best place to smoke:
the Ashtray

Whether you prefer the menthol

A f1berglass—infus_ed taste of Newports or

the cowboy—killer ﬂavor of Marlboro

ing rush of cancer.

able, cement benches and assortment of

Best residence hall:
McCormick Hall

H Runner-up: Sutherland Hall

'.With some of the largest suites,
endowed with cathedral ceilings and
fireplace mantles, McCormick Hall is

"about as Town and Country as a Pitt

Dormitory can get. .

This elegant dorm is home to T67 _

men and women living  ﬁve- to eight-
person suites. Some of the suites even
have a place to cook your ramen noodles
besides the microwave or the coffee
maker. C
So if you can’t get into Sutherland

under the cathedral ceilings of the

Best place to ge.'t_arresteal:i

Towers Lobby
Rlunner-up: Cumpie’s

’ Oh, freshmen . . . when will you learn?

. When will you‘ learn notto pee in the '
elevator lobby? When will you stop pass-

ing out while your card is being swiped?
VVhen will you cease to ‘vomit on the police
officer who is asking you if you are drunk?

Until these college newcomers ‘learn

their lessons, though, the lobby of the p '

Litchﬁeld Towers, with its bright ﬂuores-
cent lights and spacious windows, remains

. «the best place to be part of — or watch —

an arrest.

In a regular weekend ritual bordering I

on spectacle, throngs of inebriated ﬂesh-

‘ men will stumble into the lobby of their

rounded dormitory, perform a profoundly
stupid act indicative of their intoxicated
state, and be promptly escorted out by a
University cop. _

For the arrested, the incident is a swift A

and important reality check that will
encourage moderation and better judgment
for the rest of their collegecareer.

But for everyone watching, it remains i

one of the most entertaining events to wit-
ness in a weekend at Pitt.

Best street for
off-campus living:
Atwood 5treet
Runner-up: Dithridge and Bouquet streets
There’s never any parking. Trash bags line the streets
seven days a week There’s a collective howling every sin-
gle night at 2 am., when the bats close. Often as not, there’s

puke in the street
It’s no wonder Atwood Street consistently gets voted

‘best street for oﬂ°—campus living. It’s a fantasyland of

debauchery! It’s disgusting! It’s foul! It’s awfully close to
campus!

Atwood Street, with its numerous taverns and dining
establishments, is the poor man’s South Side. 'Ihe1e’s a
liquor store, and, with the recent welcome addition of the
oh—so-punk-rock White Hen, three local convenience
stores, not to mention a 24—hour franchise convenience
store. In terms of rocking the South Oakland lifestyle,
Atwood Street is about as prestigious an address as any
beer-fueled undergrad could hope for. For years to come,
the ‘Wood will remain untouchable as the reigning king of
streets. Sony, Chesterﬁeld Road.

Best hotel for
your parents:
Holiday Inn
Runner-up: Wyndham Gardens Hotel

You know they’re coming sometime.

No matter how much you enjoy your college—induced
independence, the day will come when your parents throw
it all out the window and come to visit_ their little darling.

Denying the inevitable will not keep them at bay, so

1 you might as well make sure your parents are comfortable
‘during their stay. If you put your parents up in the Holiday

Inn, they’ll remain happy — read: generous — throughout '

their time on campus.

Located near the Cathedral, the Holiday Inn is close
enough that your parents can get to any dorm or apartment
in the area quickly and conveniently. Keep this in mind if
you plan to be up to no good while your parents are in
town.

But they’ll enjoy the nice accommodations and the. ‘

pleasant view of the Cathedral.

Look at itthis way —- it’s better thaniif they stay at .

your place.
— J. Elizabeth Strohm, News Editor

Best museum:
Carnegie Museums

When you think of the cities with the best
museums in the country, the first names that
come to mind are New York, Chicago and
Pittsburgh.

Wait, what? Pittsburgh?

The Carnegie system of museums, which
includes the Carnegie Museum of Natural

History, the Carnegie Museum of Art, the '

Carnegie Science Center and The Andy
Warhol Museum, boasts some of the best col-
lections in the nation. The Museum of Natural
History, for example, has one of the largest
collections of dinosaur fossils in the country.
The Warhol is renowned far and wide for
being one of the few museums in the United
States dedicated .to a single artist. And the.
Science Center, when it was built in the early
‘90s, was one ofthe largest in the nation. .

But the best thing about the Carnegie is
that, with the exception of the Science Center,
admission is free with your Pitt ID.
— Dante  Ciampaglia, Assistant A&E

Best Nationality Rooms:
Japanese and Irish
Runner-up: African

The Irish Room, just to the right of
the Cathedral’s main entrance, has a

serene feel with its chapel—like structure
and intricate stained—glass window
designs. Based on Irish Romanesque
architecture dating from the last turn of
the millennium, it has actual , and
implied isolation from the bustle of Pitt

life, ideal for a small class (although _

I’ve seen a dozen people try to cram

themselves around the table) or just
some study time when your roommate
is snoring too loudly.

The Japanese classroom on the

third ﬂoor of the Cathedral, "with its .

classic paper-and—wood decor, offers a
meditative quality that allows you to‘
sleep through even the most interesting

class. It has room for a large seminar

class, although its comfort is not leg-
endary, with its sharp right angles and
rigid chairs. However, its geometric

simplicity and collection of artifacts I

draws any passer-by’s eye. v

beats the hell out of a show at the Chevrolet

while many of the city’s venues host 2l—and—

Best happy hour:
Hemingway’s
Runner-up: Mad Mex

It’s 5:30 p.m. on a Tuesday after-
noon; do you know where your friends
are? They are probably at Hemingway’s,
avoiding that big English literature paper
or biology lab. Located right on Forbes

Hemingway’s has been a popular attrac-
tion for students and professors alike.
It’s 5:30 p.m. and class starts in half an
hour. To go to class or not to go to class

   
  

———- that’s the ques-
tion. Many students 
can be found adorning
the bar stools at
Hemingway’s any
day of the week. With
a daily $1 draft beer spe-

cial ranging from any domestics on one
night to Yuengling, Molson or Michelob
AmberBock on others, it gives students a
perfect excuse to skip that late afternoon
or night class. Every Friday at 5 p.m.,
they also offer a free happy hour buffet.
And what college student can argue with

Best drink specials:
Hen1ingWay’s
Runner-up: Mad Mex

While sitting at the bar at
'Hemingway’s recently, I was giv-
ing a verbal tour of Oakland bars to
a newcomer to Pittsburgh. I told
him to pick up a Fuel & Fuddle
Beer Bible —— that once he drank
100 beers there, he’d get his name
on a plaque. Hemmy’s venerable
bartender Larry overheard this con-
versation and noted, “Man, if we
did that here, you’d have your own
stained—glass window by now.”

It’s true; I drink a lot at
Hemingway’s, for two good rea-
sons. One is Larry. The other is
dollar drafts. You can’t beat a deal
like that, especially when you’re
an impoverished college student.
Mondays feature all domestics —
all of them! — for just a dollar
each. Take your pick of America’s
finest drafts. Then, on Tuesdays,
try the flavor of our neighbor to the
north, with a dollar draft of
Molson, eh? Wednesdays offer you
three choices: Michelob Ultra
Light, Bud Light, and Michelob
AmberBock. Thursdays mean
Miller Lite, Fridays bring you the
grand, 01’ favorite, Yuengling, and
Saturdays bring Coors Light.

Bottom line: you can get drunk

for 12 bucks (six to drink and six to
tip, you would-be; cheapskates).
That’s why Hemingway’s Drink
Specials are the best around. I

Beet etreet to party on:

even more houses. What do the people

Well, they have the Green Mansion.
And if it is any consolation to those
who will so dearly miss the booty shak-

place.

Beet bar:
Cumpie’s

Runner-up: Hemingway’s

Maybe it’s the quarter-draft Pabst special. Maybe it’s
the dance floor. Maybe it’s the windows ﬂung wide to the
bustle of Atwood Street. Perhaps it’s the Count’s Comer.
Or it could be the three — count ‘em, three — bars.

Most likely, though, it’s the Angels that have earned
Cumpie’s the title of best bar. Despite legal troubles and
a stint as a fruit stand last summer, Cumpie’s bar on the
comer of Atwood and Sennott streets simply oozes
atmosphere. The booze is cheap, the drinks are stiff, and
pretense is notably lacking. Open seven days a week
from the morning to, well, the next morning, Cumpie’s is

the place to see and be seen in Oakland.

When the weather is nice and the windows are open,
folks inside can call out a siren song of their own to
friends passing — and when Cumpie’s calls you by name
on a parched afternoon, resistance is futile.

But Horstmann didn’t get to this hal-
lowed ground of iubiquitousness all by him-

his big brother, the (in)farno11's John Paul

That’s right, the annoyance with Jesse

some lack of vision.

Best sports star and Pitt celebrity:
Larry Fitzgerald

Runner-up sports star: Rod Rutherford
Runners-up Pitt celebrity: John Hill and Adam
Causegrove

Everybody’s talking about Larry Fitzgerald,
and with good reason.

With 68 receptions for 1,282 yards and 17
touchdowns this year, the sophomore wide receiver
has already set Big East and Pitt single—season
records for touchdowns. And with eight more catch-
es and 175 more yards, Fitzgerald will set confer-
ence and school records for receptions and yardage
in a season.

Fitzgerald is also two touchdowns away from
setting a Pitt record for touchdown passes in a
career. '

“I was at Rutgers a few weeks ago, and the
assembled [National Football League] scouts left

‘drool marks on press row after watching

Fitzgerald,” ESPN Magazine senior writer Gene
Wojciechowski said recently about the receiver.
“One scout, a good one, said Fitzgerald received the
highest rating he’s ever given a player.” ’

k “This young man is legit,” said former Pitt run-
ning back and Heisman Trophy winner Tony
Dorsett. “He is the truth; the whole truth and noth-
ing but the trut .”

A candidate for the Heisman Trophy, Walter
Camp and Maxwell National Player of the Year
awards and the Biletnikoff Award, Fitzgerald leads
the nation in receiving yardage and total touch-
downs. '

And all this from a guy who is only a sopho-
more. I

Beet Pitt police officer: Tim
Dela riey
Runner-up: Curtis Smith,

Being cited is never very enjoyable. No
one wants her illegal revelry to be interrupt-
ed by an officer of the law. You face ﬁnes,
angry parents and public humiliation in the
Police Blotter. ~ .

But ‘if you have to be cited, for any
form of illicit behavior, you’d like it to be
the good Chief who writes you up.

Pitt police Chief Tim Delaney is your
favorite Pitt police officer for many reasons.
His ﬁiendly nature, sense of humor and
‘excellent manners will make any encounter

. professional but relaxed Never could a per-
son bust you for breaking the law with more
class and style than Delaney.

If you’re lucky, you’ll only run into the
chief at Pitt events, and not on official busi-
ness. But whatever the reason for your
meeting, just remember to be cordial --
according to your votes, he’s the best there

Beet Oakland regular:

Sombrero Man

 Runner-up: Opera Singer Guy

Some say he is a wealthy heir who
spends his summers living the life of a
playboy in his Squirrel Hill mansion.
Others believe he is secretly the owner of a
very powerful corporation. Very few peo-

' . ple-believe he actually came from Mexico.

Whatever your ‘beliefs 1 about
Sombrero Man '— who, contrary to rumors
of his death, is still alive, kicking and wear-
ing his trademark hat —— he’s yourfavorite
Oakland regular. He doesn’t sing or tell
elaborate lies. He’s never held an interest—.
ing sign or tried to bargain with you. He
just sits, chants and, most of the time, wears
a really cool hat‘; F 1 ,

For Sombrero Man,'that is enough.

Best Pitt professor: Ray Jones
Runner-up: Rich Scaglion

You can’t say enough about this guy. For the second year
in a row, Ray Jones is voted best teacher on campus, and for
good reason. From throwing books across the room to stand-
ing on classroom desks, this guy is among the few who can
pull off the sandals—and-suit look. And he’s not afraid to take
that suit coat off and throw it across the room.

A professor in the College of Business Administration,
Ray teaches such classes as Business Ethics and
Organizational Behavior. But beyond what he teaches from
the books, Ray motivates his students to “go out there and
make it happen, people,” hisfavorite line. He truly teaches
with a strong passion to make his students better people. A
semester with him will carry with you all the way through the
end. ,

Once I had sat down and decided to start a

Really, Melissa stood out as the obvious pick.
Who else, I thought, has the breadth of experi-
ence necessary for this‘? She’s been doing this for
years. She really knows what it’s about. She’s
won awards for all different styles and tech-
niques. She’s good in long ones and quickies.
She’s loud; she’s energetic; she’s in control of
what she’s doing. Melissa is clearly the one with
the natural ability and years of practice necessary
for this job. ' a

Best local news

personality: Peggy Finnegan

Runner-up: Brenda Blackmen

The local television news scene is con-
tinually in ﬂux. Anchors come and go as
often as FOX News bashes liberals. But, in
Pittsburgh, there are only acouple "faces that
have remained constant. One is Peggy
Finnegan of WPXI.

Since January, 1990, Finnegan has been
a staple of WPXI news. She is one half of
the longest—rur1ning news anchor team in
Pittsburgh news; the other half is David
Johnson. And during her tenure at WPXI,

— the local NBC aﬂiliate has gone from a dis-

tant third place in the local news ratings to
one that has won awards and the hearts and
minds of the city — surely thanks in some
great part to her contributions.

Notable also are her personal achieve-
ments. She is a breast cancer survivor and an
advocate of early detection, and she carried

the Olympic torch when it made its way

through Pittsburgh in 2002.

But it’s her on-air personality that‘is
most appealing. She has an obvious rapport
with co—anchor Johnson. When they work
together, the news comes fast and furious.
And when she’s reporting the news, she
does so with class and charisma — something
that can’t be said for every anchor in
Pittsburgh ,

Best wrts DJ:
‘ Craig Dicht

Runners-up: Maria Smith, Raheem

Henry, Lauren Sloan (tie)

Coming over the radio waves every
Saturday afternoon from 4 to 6 on 92.1 FM,
the “DJ Big Dicht Plays the Hits” and “Get
Dicht” WPTS disc jockey, Craig Dicht, has
certainly made an impression on campus.
That’s why he’s the best WPTS DJ for 2003.

Modesﬂy, Dicht ﬂiinks he was Voted
solely based on the fact that-he is well-con-
nected. He is cunenﬂy the vice president of
Amnesty International, he is involved With
Students in Solidarity and over the summer
worked for Scotty at his hot dog cart

Dicht said that Scotty used to tell every-
body that he was a DJ, calling out often to
customers, ‘This is Craig; he works for the
radio station.”

Dicht thinks that he will probably be
able to move past the recognition and not let
the success go to his head, though the news,
he said, “Certainly made my day, [but] it

' seemed a little absurd.”

One thing is for certain — Dicht will
continue to play the collection of vinyl he
has recently found up at the station, with
tunes that range from ‘80s rock to Christian
gospel music.

there are remaining summer items for $2 and fall buys under

Best place to buy CDs:
CD Warehouse

Runner-up: Dave’s Music Mine

‘ So the RLAA is breathing down your neck. You’ve down-
loaded a small record store’s worth of music, and the walls
are closing in. Subpoenas are coming fast and furious, and
you might be next. What to do? /

Stop the downloading without dropping your vehement
anti—recording industry stance by picking up your music at
CD Warehouse.

With the prices of new albums reaching astronomical
amounts, us poor college students are being squeezed out of
the market. And now, with the threat of costly legal action, we
can’t get our music for free anymore. Used CD stores
like CD Warehouse offer the best solution.

By buying your music from CD Warehouse,
you’re getting albums that are slightly used, at a
fraction of the cost of buying them new. And
because someone has already purchased the
disc, the ‘recording industry isn’t getting your

ries albums that a chain record store, like Best
Buy, might not haye. ’

Maybe someday in the future, new albums
will cost a more reasonable amount. But in the
meantime, if you can’t download, frequent CD
Warehouse. It’s cheap, easy, and the next best
way to stick it ‘itothe man —— err, the RIAA.

Best textbook seller:
GotUsed

Runner-up: Campus Bookstore

When dealing with boyfriends, project partners and salespeo-

ple, no one really wants to be used. '

But when it comes to textbooks, getting used is just fine with

you.

GotUsed, the renamed and relocated bookstore formerly
known as The College Store, is your favorite place to find text-
books, both old and new. With a large collection of used books
and prices in which you can revel, GotUsed can help you launch
an illustrious semester of studying —, or just carrying around

books that you know you should be reading.

Some of you just head down Forbes Avenue to GotUsed, take
care of business, and head home. Others of you check out other
textbook vendors’ prices and squeal with delight at your clever-
ness when you confirm that you have, in fact, saved $3.50 on a
$120 biology text that you never intend to open. Whatever your
shopping — or studying —— style, you can appreciate the fine
deals, friendly service and comfortable atmosphere at GotUsed

Bookstore.

Best florist: ,
Gidas

Runner-up: People on the street

Whether it be a hot pink Gerber daisy to help a best
friend get over a cheating boyfriend or a dozen red roses
from that same cheating boyfriend, Gidas Florist has the
sunflower or stargazer lily you need. Their convenient
location on campus and embellished window displays
during the holidays keep us going back for that sweet
smell of lilac. Or is it that we keep returning to escape the
rank smell of moldy pizza boxes and crusty beer cans that
pollutes Oakland? - .

The ﬂower shop is surely a change of scent from the
aromas that fill your nose on your way to class. It is def-

initely a change of atmosphere‘ from the
urban campus found -in the heart of
Oakland.

From a rose for our’ Valentine
sweetheart —— hopefully not from that
same boyfriend who is cheating on you
with your best friend, to a poinsettia
during holiday shopping, Gidas Florist
has our favorite flower for every occa-
sion. .

Best piercing and tattoo shop:
Inka Dinka Dooiand Hot Rod Body,
Piercing Co.

Runner-up: Z-Spot

When getting pierced or tattooed, one must
make sure to painstakingly research the options for
where to go. Every piercing shop and tattoo parlor is
different — and in this case, cheaper is never better.
In Oakland, the ones that stands above them all are
Inka Dinka Doo Tattoo and Hot Rod Body Piercing
Co.

Inka Dinka D00 is on the bottom of the building
on Oakland Avenue, while Hot Rod rests above.
Both are meticulously clean, and the guys who mod-
ify your bodies really know what they are doing. Hot
Rod has a reputation for their piercings rarely get-
ting infected.

Inka Dinka Doo’s tattoo artists are incredibly
talented, inking up brave souls and scaredy cats alike
with intricately detailed designs.

So if you are going to alter your appearance, at
least you can tell the ‘rents that you did it at the best
places Oakland has to offer. ‘

Runner-up: Take 2 Video

So it’s the end of a long week,

.you’ve been working too hard, and

now it’s time to unwind with your sig-
nificant other. Time to hit the bars and
get schlobberknockered, right?

Better idea: Make it a Blockbuster
night.

“What?” you say. “It’s the height
of my life socially, and I’m going to
curl up with a bottle of wine and a
movie?” ‘

Well, yeah.

You might think, at the beginning

of the night, that getting trashed is the _

best way to relax and recover, but you
won’t the next morning.

Alternative scenario: you and your
honey go to Blockbuster, grab a-ﬂick
you’ve been wanting to see, and do the
aforementioned curling with the afore-
mentioned bottle of wine. The next
morning, you are refreshed, feeling
rested; a whole lot less broke than you
would be otherwise, and you’veactual-
ly seen your boy/girlfriend and had
qualitytime with them, not just looked
at them through beer goggles you don’t
need,

Runner-‘up: Rite Aid

The walk past McKee Place may
seem daunting, and the weak students

will fall by the wayside. But for those

strong, dedicated people who make
the grueling trek to CVS on Forbes

_ Avenue, a great reward awaits.

' CVS is the uber-drug -store of

Oakland drug stores. Its multitudi- I

nous aisles offer gleaming. packages
of food, vitamins, medication, per-
sonal care items and household items.

With several aisles dedicated solely

to food, CVS can get you through an
extra week when the grocery store
doesn’t stand as an option’ in your
immediate future. The pleasing car-
peting will put a comforting bounce
in your step as you peruse the store
for all your drug store and pharmacy
needs. '

Sure, the walk will seem a little
long when several other drug stores

tempt you by their closer proximity to '

campus. But if you persevere in your
quest for a Vast haven of drug store
items, your efforts-will be rewarded.

CVS Photo Center on Forbes Avenue
is the place to go. Open from 9 a.m.

have begun using a‘ Noritsu QSS—
30ll Digital Lab ‘ System “that,
according to CVS employee Drew
McLaren, can process 30 to 40 rolls
of digital-quality film in an hour
instead of the five to 10 roll capacity
of -past lab machines,

 In addition to any film’ you get

developed,‘ for $4.99 more, you can
get a Kodak picture CD to hold the

equivalent “of three rolls worth of -

35mr'ntphotos. You can also bring in
your own CD, insert it into. the
Kodak Picture Maker Station, and
print out 4—inch—by-6-inch, prints on

* it for 29 ‘cents apiece. Lose the nega-

tives to your favorite pictures? No
problem. Just scan in a photograph at
another station and transfer the
equivalent of three 4—by-6 photos to a

VCD for $6.99. For those about to

travel abroad,‘ passport photos are
$7.99 for a set of 16 and, according

The Prirnanti’s sandwich is a Pittsburgh

tasty meal to others.

But what can’t be denied is its ur1ique—

that can be bought at other sandwich places,
like Panera. A turkey sandwich with lettuce

Best food to cook in a
dorm:
Ramen noodles
Runner-up: Easy Mac

You’re broke, you’re hungry and
you’re tired of eating at
KenTacoHut. How are you going to
settle that growling stomach? For
starters, don’t go to C—Side and def-
initely don’t eat that moldy sand-
wich in your refrigerator. Instead,
break open a pack of ramen noodles.
That’s right, ramen: that brick of
noodles accompanied by packets of
flavoring, most commonly chicken

or beef.

In order to indulge in this culi-
nary masterpiece, you need the fol-
lowing items: water.

Oh yeah, you need a microwave,
a bowl and a spoon, too, but if you
didn’t know that, you don’t belong
in college, my friend.

By the way, if you ever get tired
of ramen noodles, don’t worry, they
have plenty of alternative uses. Why
not use a brick as an exfoliating
sponge or as a scouring pad for pots
and pans? And why not use a few
bricks as a set of bookends? On sec-
ond thought, if you’re living off
ramen, chances are you can’t afford
books. Scratch that idea.

Best Mexican food:
Mad Mex
Runner-up: Qdoba

Mad Mex, with its eclectic and
innovative take on Mexican cooking,

is the best place to satisfy your south— ’

of—the—border cravings — and lay
waste to your sobriety.“ '

This legendary Oakland eatery,
located on the scenic corner of Bates
and Atwood, has a menu to satisfy
any palate, from the timid to the
adventurous. While the salads, enchi-_
ladas, chimichangas, wraps and sand-
wiches are all muy bien, you really
gotta try a burrito: a “piggie—sized”

hulking mass of goodness heavy

enough to crush that annoying little
Chihuahua into a whimpering pulp.
In addition to. basic, no—fril1s burritos,
Mex serves up such creative choices
as the Thai curry burrito, the chick
pea chili burrito and the Yinzo burri-
to — the perfect Mexican tribute to
Pittsburgh, chock-full of steak, fries,
lettuce, tomato and coleslaw. And to
the delight of many a veg-head, Mex
offers portobello mushroom and tofu
as substitutions for meat, as well as
soy cheese and tofu sour cream.

But what’s a burrito without a
bangin’ margarita? Luckily, Mex
serves up the headiest in town- Its 20-
ounce concoctions —- priced at a
laughably affordable $5 during happy
hour — will have you speaking ﬂuent‘
Spanish before you’re out the door.

Beet T hai/pan-Aeian food:
Spice leland Tea House and
Thai Place Cafe (tie)

Runner-up: Lu Lu’s

Thai Place Cafe is an eatery perfectly
at home. on South Craig Street — quaint,
quiet, and clean. It offers some of the best
Asian food inall of Pittsburgh, with a vari-
ety of noodle and rice. dishes, as well as
some more typical Chinese-style dishes,
including the best General Tso’s Chicken
you’re likely to ﬁnd anywhere. Their appe-
tizers are also incredible, and the duck noo-
dle soup is a must-have.

Spice Island, on the other hand, seems
very much out of place on Atwood Street.
Its atmosphere — hipper, more aesthetic,
and more ornate than Thai Place’s, is more
Greenwich Village than South Oakland,
and it would make an excellent‘ little spot
for a date. The food is less oriented to spici-
ness and sweetness than many other Asian
restaurants around. Instead, varied textures
and ﬂavors are strengths here. Their expan-
sive vegetarian selection is noteworthy, as
are their delicious skewers. A wide array of
tea selections, both hot and cold, also
makes Spice Island a ﬁtting alternative to
your typical coffee spots around campus.

Best Middle Eastern food:
Ali Baba’e and Baba D’e-(tie)

Few things are quite as satisfying as good Middle
Eastern food, and Oakland is lucky enough to have two
shining examples of_such. For a no-ﬁills, inexpensive, yet
magically delicious Middle Eastern meal, Baba D’s is your
best bet. Their baba ghanouj is among ‘the best I’ve ever
had, their falafel is excellent, and their gyros are ﬁlled with
the thickest-cut, juiciest, and best-seasoned meat I’ve ever
had in a gyro. For more elaborate dishes in a classier
ambiance, go to Ali Baba’s. Though pricier than Baba D’s, ,
you canit be disappointed with their wide selection of del-
icately spiced dishes. Don’t miss their mohomara and
rnujaddara appetizers. Their roasted eggplant is a belly-
rubbing delight, as well. If you have yet to sample either of

’ these restaurants, I command you to do so_forthwith.

Beet wings:
The Wing Pitt
Runner-up: The Wing Zone

They serve gyros, they serve hamburg-
ers, they serve cheesesteaks, but they made
a name for themselves — literally —— with
their wings.

Eighteen varieties of wings await you at
ﬂie Wing Pitt: your standard hot wings, bar-
beque wings, honey mustard wings, hot gar-
lic wings, and — of course — the ever—danger—
ous atomic wings. Whereas other establish-
ments produce wings that have been rolled
around in a weak, runny sauce, Wing Pitt

‘wings express their character through their

rich, potent seasonings, replete with fresh-
ground pepper and herbs that distinguish
them Visually from every other wing in
Oakland.

A pound (around ten wings) will cost I

you only about $6 and comes with bleu

cheese for dipping, as well as some cucurn—
ber slices‘ to help you cool down. If you

don’t feel like hiking down to their Sernple
Street location, just browse their online
menu at wwwwingpittcom and phone in
your order — they’ll deliver to most of
Oakland.

Beet Pitt Scandal:
Basketball Tickets

Runners-up: Rod Rutherford and
tuition

Again this year, student basketball fans
feel cheated.

Pitt’s athletics department attempted to
make this year’s process for choosing
which students get season tickets for bas-

_ ketball judicious. Last season, wristbands

were handed out to students at Midnight _
Madness and students had to rely on being
one of 1000 students chosen in a lottery.
This year, fans were supposed to be
able to log onto Pitt athletics’ Web site, and
the ﬁrst 1400 students to enter a valid Pitt
ID number, e—mail address and credit card
number were supposed to get tickets.

W ‘*2 egg

#1 BEST‘ l{anAoi«:E

Somehow, the athletics department did
not have the foresight to make sure that it
beefed up the Web site’s capacity. As a
result, when thousands of students attempt-
ed to log on and get their tickets at the same
time, the Web site crashed.

To make matters worse, the Petersen
Events Center’s ticket ofﬁce began selling
tickets over the phone and to students who
walked up to the Pete. Those students who
could not make it to the Pete or continued
following the procedure that the athletics
department set were out of luck and season
tickets.

Now students without tickets have to
depend on current season ticket holders not
to pick up their tickets for certain games. If
this occurs, unclaimed tickets go back on
sale to students.

» If it makes you feel better, it’s very like-

to Frazier Street probably received equally
misleading guidance just a few short years
ago. And, just soon you’ll be able to

just as alcohol diminishes the perceived
necessity of sleep in the evening, class in the

The result is that early mornings turn

 Best fraternity:
Phi Kappa Alpha
Runner-up: Sigma Alpha Epsilon

Most known for their annual Luau
party every spring, the Phi Kapps came in
ﬁrst place as best fraternity on Pitt’s campus
this year. According to Rob Sully, president
of Phi Kappa Theta, planning for the luau
starts in January and it takes about three
months to get all avenues planned. Currently
with 41 members and 13 pledges, they are
looking to increase participation within the
Greek community on campus.

“I don’t know whether or not we’re bet-
ter than any other fraternity, but we’ve
improved internally a whole lot over the last
three years,” Sully said. The Phi Kapps are
cunently working with their nationals to set
up an intercollegiate charity ftmction
between Pitt, Duquesne University and
Carnegie Mellon University. “W1rrning best
fratemity is a nice compliment, and now that
we’re back and partying, we’re going to try
to live up to the title,” Sully said.

Best sorority:
Theta Phi Alpha

Rrrrmer-up: Delta Delta Delta

 

At a time when Catholic women were
not welcome to fraternal organizations, 10
founding Catholic sisters at the University of
Michigan created Theta Phi Alpha in 1912.
They stood for ideals of sisterhood, society,
scholarship, friendship and service. Since
then, Theta Phi Alpha has expanded to
include women of all religions and beliefs
and can be described as friendly, motivated
and diverse.

Theta Phi Alpha supports two national
philanthropic causes, the Glenmary Lay
Missioners and the House That Theta Phi
Alpha Built. ,

At Pitt, the Kappa chapter of Theta Phi
Alpha was founded in 1922.. These ener-
getic sisters worked this year already to raise
money for the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric
AIDS Foundation. They walked for dia-
betes, volunteered at the Animal Rescue
League and adopted Semple Street for
cleanup.

Theta Phi Alpha sisters are active in
many campus organizations, such as the Pitt
Pathﬁnders, ' the University Chamber
Orchestra, the Women’s Choral Ensemble,

' the Golden Key Honor Society and the

National Society of Collegiate Scholars.
With 40 active sisters and 10 women

pledging this fall, we can expect to see Theta

Phi Alphas adamantly participating in Greek

.Week events and helping out the Pitt com-

munity all throughout the year, making them
the best sorority at Pitt.

Best on-ca mpus job:
Pathfinder
Runners-up: Peterson and Telefact
So you’re looking for a job where you

can inﬂuence the futures of impressionable
youth but you don’t have a teaching degree?

V Why not be a Pathﬁnder? It’s an opport1mi-

ty to advertise your school to potential fresh-
man while getting paid. Almost everyone
remembers when they were led around Pitt
by a Pathﬁnder and shown all of the sights,
from the C-Side Marketplace where you can

“Eat all you want’ ’ for just one block, to the
rooms of Towers which are “Really a lot
roomier than they appear.” And how many
people discovered their sudden love for col-
lege sports when told students could get
great deals on season tickets?

To many, a Pathﬁnder was their ﬁrst
taste of Pitt and college life in Oakland. They
may even be the person who convinced
them to attend Pitt. And if that power to
change someone’s future isn’t enticing
enough, just remember what really makes
being aPathﬁnderthebestjob atPitI—the

High

Who hasn’t screamed their
lungs out to “Penny on the Floor” or
“Cigarette?” And if you don’t know
what the Fayette County Fair is, ﬂien
you obviously aren’t a Clarks fan.

The Clarks have been together
and going strong since the late ‘80s,
probably about the time most stu-
dents at Pitt were still learning to tie

and they have given no signs of let-

their shoes and color inside the lines, 9

ting up, as they continue to tour and
make even more of a name for
themselves and rock music from
Pittsburgh.

The success of last year’s
“Another Happy Ending” has been
exactly what the Highland Park
natives, who started playing panies
for cases of beer, have been working
for. And all of their hard work is
ﬁnally paying olf.

Currently, the hometown boys
are on a national tour, giving a taste
of Pittsburgh to the rest_of the coun-
try; but don’t worry — they remem-
ber their roots. They have three
