DAVE HARTMAN

Staunch supporters ventured to
Arnold Palmer Airport in Westmoreland
County, Pennsylvania, Thursday night to
welcome Democratic vice presidential
nominee Joe Lieberman to the area as he
stepped off his plane into the cold
November air.

Hundreds showed up at the event
where state Democratic candidates

including Ron Klink, Jim Eisenhower
and Catherine Baker Knoll joined labor
leaders like President of the
Pennsylvania AFL—CIO Bill George in
rousing the chilly crowd before
Liebennan’s plane landed.
“Pennsylvania’s the grand prize of
the election,” George said, calling
Tuesday, “themost important election of
our time.” Speakers took turns attacking
state and national republican candidates
for their political views and histories.
Klink, the Democratic nominee for
U.S. Senate, criticized his oppo-
nent Rick Santorum, calling
him anti—labor and accusing the
incumbent senator for living in
Virginia while he continues to
represent Pennsylvania.

Lieberman arrived in a
red, White and blue plane called
Spirit. The crowd cheered as he
descended the plane’s steps and
approached the podium.

“I’ve got a feeling
we’re on the road to the White
House,” Lieberman said. He
said he was glad to be in

Barbara Bush wears
her pearls to brunch

SHANNON MCLAUGHLIN
News Editor

The strands of pearls were almost as
abundant as the blue suits and White hair
on Friday at the Westin William Penn.

Former first lady Barbara Bush -
farnous for her signature choker pearl
necklace and sapphire-blue business
suit — appeared in front of nearly 1,500
women, whom she collectively dubbed
the “wear your pearls to brunch bunch”
at the late—moming brunch.

“Sometimes I think I did for pearls
what George Bush did for Dana
Carvey,” she joked.

Elsie Hilhnan, former Pennsylvania
representative for the Republican
National Committee, hosted the brunch
from her home, via satellite, after suffer-
ing from a heart attack last week.

The two friends conversed over the
satellite link, and Hillman was clear in
her support of the former first 1ady’s
son.

“If you feel you’d like to have two
presidents in your family, it’s OK with

the rest of us,” she said.

Indeed, Bush’s primary reason for
visiting the vitally important swing state
of Pennsylvania on Friday was to dis-
cuss one of her “very favorite topics —
why George W. Bush should be the next
president’ of the United States.”

‘ She said her son is “the right [can-
didate] at the right time.”

with Nader via satellite

CARL WESSEL

The Pitt News

Pitt’s Campus Greens assembled in
Posvar Hall yesterday to View the last of
presidential nominee Ralph Nader’s

. “Super Rallies.”

» The rally was broadcast via satellite
from the eVent’s site at the MCI Center in
Washington, D.C. to room lM56 Posvar
Hall, and was also televised on C-SPAN.

_ The group looked on as Nader sup-
porters spoke about the campaign and the
Green party’s issues. Among the speak-
ers were former talk-show host Phil
Donahue, Chuck D. of Public Enemy,
Adam Yauch of. the Beastie Boys, actor
Darmy Glover and Nader himself.

Nader ‘spoke about his presidential
platform to cameras and a crowd of tens
of thousands of enthusiasts in the arena.
He covered topics including District of
Columbia statehood, negative corporate
inﬂuence in the political system and uni-
versal health care.

Pitt’s Campus Greens took donations
and bought pizza and soda for all who

attended. They also distributed free

posters, pins, stickers and information
about the Green party. Similar satellite

viewings of the rally took place at 830

college campuses nationwide.

When asked about the importance
Nader’s last super rally, leader of the
Campus Greens Mark Yokim said that
the rally addressed issues -ignored by
pollsters and mainstream media.

Yokim gave examples of how these

_ issues affect students of this University in

particular. He talked about the cell phone
company representatives in front of the
William Pitt Union, and how they are a
symbol of corporate inﬂuence on cam-
pus.

When asked if he thought Ralph
Nader would do better or worse than
speculated in the Nov. 7 election, Yokim
said he was conﬁdent that the Nader
campaign “will definitely get the 5 per-
cent needed for matching funds for the
next election.”

ONLINE EXCLUSIVE:

Protesters demonstrated in front of Mark Nordenberg’s home on
Saturday, urging the University to extend health care rights to same-sex
partners of Pitt employees.

As the rally entered its second hour,
Fairchild stepped on stage to speak about her
work with the vice president, as well as her
disgust with Bush, the governor of her home
state.

“I don’t want to do to America what
[Bush] did to my home state,” she said.

Fairchild spoke about her work with
Gore in the 1980s, saying that she was
impressed with his knowledge and integrity.

“I’1l tell you something,” Fairchild said.
“This guy is smart.”

At 9: 15 p.m., Taylor took the stage. The
musician ‘urged the crowd to recognize the
importance of the election.

“We’re not talking about a frat house
here, we’re talking about the white house,”

FROM PAGE 1

Taylor said. A

Taylor played “Carolina in My Mind,”
“Fire and Rain” and “Sweet Baby James,”
speaking brieﬂy between each song in sup-
port of Gore. He said he was mystiﬁed by
undecided voters, insisting that there is no
question who is the better candidate.

Shortly after 10 p.rn., Gore stepped on
stage. '
‘‘My opponent likes to say that we were
a lot better eight years ago than we are today,
but I don’t go for that,” Gore said as cheers
echoed across the crowd.

Gore spoke about his disillusionment
with the political process as a young man,
and pledged to work against stereotypical
politics. He promised that, if elected, he will
hold weekly open meetings across the coun-
try to keep in touch with the people.

“The job of president is the job of ﬁght-
ing for all the people,” he said. “I’m rtmning

for president because I want to ﬁght for
you.”

Gore emphasized the importance of this
year’s election, pointing out that between
three and ﬁve Supreme Court Justices will
likely be appointed in the next four years. He
said that Bush backs people like Antonin
Scalia and Clarence Thomas. Because jus-
tices serve a life term, Gore pointed out that
the men or women appointed by the next
president will decide constitutional interpre-
tation for decades to come.

Gore addressed what he said was a need
to raise the minimum wage by a dollar “for
those that need it most.” He also emphasized
the importance of tackling the wage inequal-
ity between men and women in the work-
place.

“I’m for an equal day’s pay for an equal
day’s work,” he said. .

He spoke in favor of campaign ﬁnance

Social Security program and gun laws
designed to save lives. The Vice president
emphasized that his gun laws wouldn’t
atfect hunters or sportsman but would aim to
keep guns out of schools and out of the
- hands of criminals.

I Gore said he supports a middle class tax
cut and wants to make college tuition tax-
deductible, up to $10,000.. He criticized
Bush’s tax plan as focused on relieving only
the wealthiest members of society.

Gore attacked what he referred to as
Bush’s trickle down economics. “Been
there, done that, still paying the bill,” he said
“We’re not going back, we’re going for-
Ward” 1 -

Gore said he hopes to balance the bud-
get, invest in public schools, pay down _tl1e
deﬁcit and make sure every American child
has access to health care. p

Fireworks exploded in the air as Gore
‘ended his speech. ,_'

The vice president shook hands with
some members of the cheering crowd after
confetti exploded into the air and supporters
shouted words of encouragement and waved

signs in support of his campaign. '

“I’m dying to point out that [Al

Pointing out Pennsylvania’s essen-

OPINIONS  

EDITORIAL
In Gore we trust  

For The Pitt News, Saturday’s
rocking rally at the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers in
the South Side sealed the decision: Al
Gore is the candidate we choose to
endorse for the presidency.

Gore, how do we love thee? Let
us count the ways:

- You are extremely dedicated to
making higher education accessible
and aﬁordable for all Americans. For
example, you are proposing to make
up to $10,000 of college tuition tax-
deductible. Furthermore, you have a
record of supporting higher education
under the Clinton administration,
including working to increase the Pell
grant in 1997 and casting the deciding -
vote in favor of the 1993 proposition;
that enacted the direct student ‘loan
program, which allows students to

apply for college loans from the fed- _

eral government. L
- You played a critical role on the

congressional committee that corn- 6

mercialized the Internet, making;pub-
lie the network that now allows us to"
conduct last-minute research for our
term papers with-the greatest of ease
and keep in touch with family mem-
bers and friends from home.

- You prioritize keeping Social
Security funds in a “lockbox,” as you
mentioned at the speech you deliv-
ered Labor Day Downtown and the
rally you led Oct. 27 on the campus of
Carnegie Mellon University.

- You support health care for
same-sex partners, an issue rendered
very personal for many of us as it has
been a ﬁery controversy on this carn-
pus for the past few years.

- You are committed to protecting
a woman’s right to choose, the current
law with regard to abortion. While in
Congress you co—sp0nsored the
Freedom of Choice Act, and under
Clinton you supported the Freedom to
Access Clinic Entrances law in 1994.

- The makeup of the Supreme
Court is going to change over the next
four years, as three to ﬁve of the cur-
rent justices are expected to be
replaced over that time. We trust that

youlwill choose justices who will pre-

serve the Iights we have fought to
obtain in the Supreme Court over the
last few. decades, including but cer-
tainly not limited to a woman’s right
to choose.

Vice President Gore, we trust that

as we complete our educations, .
- become a part of working America

and begin to raise farn i lies of our

own, you will continue to._.lead ‘us_

bravely, preserving our freedom, safe-
ty and prosperity. This is a mighty
challenge indeed but we have total
faith that you will answer to it whole-
heartedly. -

As you have proven throughout
this campaign and your political
career that you believe in us, we
believe in you. 8

Some critical questions on the

importance of skin color

As Iwas stumbling throughmy thoughts‘

the other day a few questions came into my mind
that I didn’t know how to answer.

g Why am I so light? Was ‘it because of some ,
voluntary act on behalf of my great-grandmotlr .
er? Was it a result of a relationship based on love ‘

and respect? Was she happy with the baby that

A came from her master? Why can’t I admit it if,
she was raped? Was she held down with a knife

orthe threat of what would happen if she said
no? Am I held down with fear, the same
fear that held my great-grandmother
down? Where is this fear that is
breathing down my neck coming -
from? ' » .

Why hide the fact that I am not
100 percent black? Why not admit that
some of my ancestors are white, Indian and
Mexican? Why must I have some little blonde
hairs? And why does my mother have straight
hair? Why does my sister refuse to admit that she
believes only long straight hair is beautiful and
that blue eyes are all she has ever wanted?

Are you looking at me because I am this
light? Why do you, someone from the same
mother, hate me? Do you think I am better than
you because I am light? Do you believe that I
have it easy because I am so light? Why must we
divide ourselves by the melanin in our skin?
Why must we divide ourselves by the roundness
of our butts_ or the fullness of our lips?

Why is my girlfriend afraid to show the
length of her hair and instead continuously wears
a weave? Why does my brother straighten his
hair? What is good hair? Is there any such thing

_ as good hair? Isn’t good hair healthy hair? And
if so, do all Caucasian people have good hair?

Why do I look for women with long hair?
Why do I feel the urge to run my ﬁngers through
my woman’s hair? Am I looking for a woman
with relaxed hair or with hair that is not all her
own? ’

Why is a sister not considered to have a
raised conscious if her hair is not natural? Is it not
the reason behind the straightening that counts?

  
 
  
 
 
   

Why do ‘I claim to love black beauty but only

look at light skinned and light-eyed, long-haired
women with narrow hips and narrow lips? Or
why only admire one of my sisters because she
is dark—skinned? Why do we have to take turns
being “in”? , .
Ifl do not hit women ﬂien am I not respect-
ing women? Is there a difference in hitting and
shaking a woman? A threat is only a threat,
right? Do I respect my mother? Would I call her
a ho or a trick? Would I yell at her or belit-
tle her? Can I tell her where to be and at
what time to get there? Is she my
property? '
Why am I not forming study
0 groups with others? Aml better off

Do I need to look back and help
someone who is going through the
exact same thing I did in the past? Is it an
obligation of mine or is it something that is said
by people with too much time on their hands?
Do I care about anyone other than myself? Do I
make the world better or just better for myself?
Should I check myself? 9 ‘

Why must I be made to sit in the master’s
house because my genes were expressed in a
certain manner? Why must my sister stay out-
side in the sun because of the way her genes
were expressed? Why can’t I enjoy my family’s
company? _ .

Are you, someoneoutside, still mad even
though I did not choose the house? Why must
we divide ourselves by the house and the ﬁeld?
Do you think I do not understand your issues
because of a difference of a few shades?

In your mind are you in the house or are you
in the ﬁeld? Are you getting closer to the house

I or standing still? Is the house your ultimate goal

or is my company enough to sustain you? I could
be in the house, but I choose not to. You have a
choice. My question to you is do you choose the

house?

Chris Starr always has a lot of questions.

' alone? Can I do this all by myself?’

Antonio Bryant fumbles the ball in the third quarter of Saturday's loss to North Carolina.

Carolina defensive line rises to
the occasion to slow down Pitt

SHAUN GRIFFIN

Staff Writer

While 407 total yards allowed is not a spec-
tacular statistic for the North Carolina Tar Heels,
defense, the defensive line made enough big plays
against the Pitt’s offensive line; including forcing
through for six sacks, to secure a 20-17 win at
Three Rivers Stadium Saturday night.

“They were big,” said Pitt junior backup quar-
terback David Priestley of _the North Carolina
defensive line that continually harassed him after
replacing senior quarterback John Turman for the

second_half of the game. "They brought more to
the linethan we had to block.”

‘ Priestley found that out the hard way, being on
the receiving end of three sacks, including one on
the Panthers’ last offensive possession of the game
ending Pitt’s hopes for a win.

“We had trouble blocking them all night
long,” Pitt head coach Walt Harris said. “The
physicalness of the defensive line was to me, in

regards to the offense, the difference in the offen- V

sive game.”
Throughout the game, the Tar Heels broke

Pitt falls to 5-3  
after20-17 loss
to North Carolina

KAREN BIELAK
Staff Writer

It was a classic case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.

The Pitt football team, which was defeated by North
Carolina 20-17 Saturday night, in no way resembled the team
that almost upset Virginia Tech the week before.

The best explanation that head coach Walt Harris and team
members could come up with was an unsuccessful week of
practice and underestimation of the opponent.

“We prepared poorly and obviously made some mistakes,”
Harris said. “They have talent, and you have to givethem cred-
it for showing up and playing like they did.”

The Panthers came out ﬂat rom the start, as they were
unable to produce on their first drive and were forced to punt.
The Tar Heels gained possession, but three straight incomplete
passes by quarterback Ronald Curry gave the ball back to Pitt.

The Panthers opened the drive with a 17-yard rush from
Kevan Barlow and ended it with a 39-yard ﬁeld goal attempt by
Nick Lotz. The kick was good to put Pitt on the board first by a
score of 3-0.

With just over a minute left in the first quarter and North
Carolina at first and goal, Willie Parker took the ball into the end

zone for the touchdown, giving the Tar Heels their ﬁrst lead of
the game. The kick was good, and North Carolina led 7-3.

The next Panthers drive opened with a sack of quarterback
John Turman, just one of six sacks in the game. A false start
penalty on Pitt moved the team back 5 yards, making it second
and 25. Despite a 16-yard pass to Barlow, the offense was
unable to get a first down and was forced again to punt.

The Panthers continued to be unable to execute the funda-
mentals, as.the North Carolina punt was fumbled by Tim Stein
and recovered by Dexter Reid of the Tar Heels at the Pitt 15-
yard line. It resulted in a 33-yard ﬁeld goal by Jeff Reed to
extend the North Carolina lead to 10-7.

The Panthers tied the game on the next drive, as Turman

7 connected with Antonio Bryant on an 84-yard pass that was
deﬂected by ‘a North Carolina defender for the touchdown. It
was the longest catch of Bryant’s career and the sixth longest
play from the line of scrimmage for Pitt. '

With 52 seconds left in the half, North Carolina once again
pulled in front with a 32-yard ﬁeld goal from Reed. The
Panthers were unable to put a quick drive together and went to
the locker room unexpectedly trailing the Tar Heels 13-10.

“As a team, we were surprised at halftime. We didn’t know
why we were down,” backup quareterback David Priestley said.

Dreamseason ends  

for men’s   soccer team

MARIO MACHI

Sports Editor

A season filled with new team

records and accomplishments ended"

yesterday as the upstart Pitt men’s
soccer team fell to Seton Hall, 2-1, in
the Big East Tournament quarterfinals
at Chuck Knox Stadium at Quaker

_ Valley High School.

Pitt finished the season with .a
record of 13-5. The Panthers received
the program’s first Top-10 ranking
midway through the year and were
ranked as high as seventh in the
nation. But the hopes of a Big East
title were ended yesterday by the
Pirates. ‘

“It hurts a lot,” Pitt head coach Joe
Luxbacher said. “But I don’t want to
take anything away from this season.
We had a great season.” ,

Pitt came into the game as the
fourth seed in the conference, while
Seton Hall was seeded fifth. The
Pirates got on the board in the 13th
minute when midfielder Luke
Vercollone dribbled past two Pitt
defenders, forcing Pitt goalie Justin
Gaul to come to the top of the goal
box. When Gaul challenged
Vercollone, the two players collided
and the ball went to forward Gregory
Strohmann, who drilled it into the net
for a 1-0 Seton Hall lead.

chances to tie the game in the first half
but never got a shot past Seton Hall
goalie Alex McDonald.‘ Just after
Strohmann’s goal, Pitt’s Peter Veltri

dribbled down the left side of the field   1
and left the ball behind for Bryan H 

Hopper, whose shot was handledwbyij
McDonald. . ’
A few minutes later, Tim
Montgomery, ‘took a shot and Mark
Sikora slid into try to deﬂect it, but
McDonald grabbed the ball just before
Sikora got to it. ‘ .
On the next Panther possession-, it
was Sikora again who put the pressure
on the Seton Hall defense. After beat-
ing a defender to the ball, Sikpra
moved in and fired a shot that was
going to be about 10 feet wide of the

net. However, it hit Seton Hall defend— .

er Torsten Knor’s foot, deﬂecting the
ball back toward the goal and ending
up about two feet wide.

“I thought we missed a couple of
chances early,” Luxbacher said. “We
just didn’t take advantage of our
opportunities.”

The second half began with an
offensive onslaught by Seton Hall that
eventually led to the second goal of
the game. * " I

Hands of Stein, time managementcost Pitt against UNC

Something was missing from Saturday’s home foot-
ball game against North Carolina. , » .

You could make an argument for there being a lack
of a running game for the most part. It’s also plausible if
you suggest‘ that the special teams’weren’t so special on
Saturday. .

’ The 20-17 loss was heartbreaking and
I’ll get to that, but no, the thing that was if‘ 
missing actually made me smile. \
, Maybe you didn’t notice, but the scoreboard ‘
did not show the ﬁnal of the Penn State-Iowa ‘
game. ‘ 5.
If yowdidn’t know, the Nittany Lions lost 2'
again, in double-overtirne, at home, to the J
Hawkeyes. » '

Perhaps the Panthers’ scoreboard oper-
ator didn’t get the score reported to him, but
Iﬁnd that hard to believe, considering the
Panthers’ obsession with what Penn State
does.

By passing on displaying the score to the fans at
Three Rivers Stadium, the focus remained on a celebra-
tion of the 1980 Pitt team and on the game at hand
against a pitiful Tar Heels squad.

Naturally, if the score had‘ been shown, the fans
would have screamed their heads off, happy because
Penn State lost.

  
   
   
   

1' @3119:

The fact is, Penn State is in a different conference,
the Panthers beat them earlier in the year, and when they
can’t beat UNC,‘ Penn State shouldbecome a long, for-
gotten memory. . * ' e -

- What is it with the coaching staff’s
: time management skills? At Virginia Tech,
_ the Panthers called two timeouts on the
" -Hokies’ last drive but waited at least ﬁve sec-
_ onds each time to call it. . .
-This time, Pitt wasted two timeouts
early in the second half, so when the Panthers
. needed to stop the clock when they'were down
' ‘  _ three points with a minute to go, they could-
’ n’t.
I’m a big fan of what Walt Harris has
done here at Pitt, and I’m very afraid that
‘he may someday go elsewhere, because it
would be a big loss.

I’m not a big fan of clock mismanage-
ment and I’m not a big fan of players calling timeouts
because they’re rusty and can’t ﬁgure out what play was
just called or where people need to be (see David
Priestley).

0 To be negative after a crucial loss to North

Carolina is too easy. The Panthers are so close to turn-

ing the corner that they might have lost sight of where
the corner is. _ . '

When someone or something needs to turn a corner,
the seeker too often misses and goes straight ahead or
falls behind. 1' A » —

Harris can justify losses at Syracuse in a very noisy
Carrier Dome and at Virginia Tech to one of the better
teams in the nation, but no excuses can‘ be taken for
Saturday’s loss, and according to Harris, none are given.

.0 The sure-handed Tim Stein muffed two punts in
the loss, and that’s unacceptable.

When you are out there to throw your hand in the air
and catch a ball, one mistake can be accepted, but two
mistakes are ludicrous.

The not-so-special teams of the Panthers led to the
loss, because UNC had an inept offense and only scored
after Panthers turnovers.

- Where can Pitt ﬁnd a kicker like Jeff Reed of
North Carolina? All of Reed’s ﬁve kickoffs were
nowhere close to being returnable.

Pitt lost the game of ﬁeld position because of him.

Brad Cuprik is the assistant sports editor of The Pitt
News and is wondering if the corner will ever be found
again.

“We were caught off guard.”

The defense stepped up for Pitt on the
first drive of the second half, as Shawn
Robinson intercepted a Curry pass at the
Pitt 9—yard line. Robinson picked up his
ﬁfth interception of the season. But the
offense turned the ball right back over as
Bryant fumbled the ball on the second
play of the drive.

On the possession, North Carolina set
up to kick a ﬁeld goal but it was a fake, as
the ball was kept but brought down at the
25-yard line where the Panthers took
over. The offense was unable to get any-
thing going, as their next two possessions
resulted in punts. Then Pitt had a botched
ﬁeld goal attempt of its own, as the ball
was kept by Stein where he was taken

down at the North Carolina 38-yard line.

Harris tried to jump start the offense
on its next drive by bringing in Priestley
at quarterback. Turman was not at full
strength, as he was given an IV at half-
time due to dehydration. But the change
made no difference, as the mistakes con-
tinued. Priestley was sacked, and he fum-
bled the ball, which was recovered by the
Tar Heels.

The first pass from Curry on the next
drive was picked off by Gary Urschler,
his first career interception. The Panthers
then tried to move down the ﬁeld but
found themselves at third and 34 and then
fourth and 20 and were forced to punt.

Pitt got great ﬁeld position, putting
the Tar Heels on the 2-yard line to start
the drive. But North Carolina strung
together a 98-yard drive, capped off by
the 2-yard touchdown run by Anthony

Saunders. With less than six minutes left
in the game, the Tar Heels had extended
their lead to 20-10. .

“That drive was the most frustrating
part of the game,” Bryan Knight said.
“All game we were looking for other
plays and were out of position. We just
mentally underestimated.”

The Panthers answered right back
with a tally of their own, as Priestley con-
nected with Latef Grim and the kick by
Lotz cut the lead to three. After the Tar
Heels punted on their next possession,
Pitt had hopes of pulling out a victory in
the ﬁnal minutes. 0

With two minutes left on the clock,
Priestley threw three incomplete passes
before being sacked on fourth and 10. The
Tar Heels took over and were able to run
out the clock to secure the 20-17 win.

“We did not play like the team we

have been throughout the season,” Harris
said. “I did not recognize some of the
things that were going on out there.”

. The Panthers were able to put up 407
total yards but could not execute in the
crucial situations. They were just ﬁve of
15 on third—down conversions and zero of
two on fou1th—down conversions. Pitt also
fumbled the ball four times, three of
which were lost, and took a total of eight
penalties. '

receptions for 212 yards, giving him a
total of 1,042 yards on the season and
making him just the third player in Pitt
history to record more than 1,000 yards in
a season. The other two Panthers to
accomplish the feat are Grim last season
and Dietrich Jells in 1992.

Grim also passed a milestone of his
own, ﬁnishing the game with four catch-
es for 48 yards. Grim is now the all-time
leading receiver in Pitt history, moving
ahead of Jells.

But these accomplishments are no
consolation for the loss. The Panthers are
still in search ‘of their sixth win, which
would make them bowl eligible. But
more importantly, they are looking to win
every game.

“Some people think we just need one
win, but we need to win all of the games,”
Bryant said. “We have to go out and exe-
cute and not practice like we did.”

Harris noted that the team is going to
have to beconsistent otherwise it will not
win football games. The Panthers now
have to prepare to face one of the top
teams in the nation in Miami, a task that
is certainly made more difﬁcult by the
loss. - ‘
“We did not come out andplay like
we should have, we were intimidated,”

A offensive lineman Jeff McCur1ey said.

“But we have to put this behind us and
forget about it.”

On November 9, 2000, from 6 to 9 p.m., students are invited to a
meeting in the Ballroom of the William Pitt Union, hosted by the
Provost’s Office and The Student Government.

At that time, we wish to receive recommendations regarding what major, annual, exciting
events we might sponsorinvolving undergraduates liom all sectors of the Pittsburgh
campus. Over time, it is our intent that the very best successﬁil events will

0 become   major events that armually enjoy strong campus-

wide support, leading to a very strong, vibrant, and integrated undergraduate campus

community ~

 

 

At the November 9"‘ Open forum, students will be asked to recommend the following:

1. The Substance of Pitt Traditions Many of you will recall the way the campus
community came together for this year ’s Pitt/Penn State football game. We look
forward to receiving your suggestions regarding other athletic, social, academic,
service, community, and campus-based learning events that could become “Pitt
Traditions, ” events for which there is annual, enthusiastic and widespread
students participation.

2. Timing of Events We invite your suggestions regarding which “Pitt Traditions”
might be day-long, several days, or all week events. .

We also wish to receive other recommendations regarding how best to build _a sense of
community among the undergraduates on campus, one that leaves you highly satisﬁed
A with your university experiences and very proud of Pitt.

Jack L. Daniel, Vice Provost
Joan Snyder, Student Government President

through the protection forcing the quar-
terbacks to scramble, throw the ball
away ortake a sack. On the six occa-
sions when Turman and Priestley hit the
turf for a loss, the momentum swung in
the Tar Heels’ favor, turning Pitt touch-
down possibilities into either ﬁeld goal
attempts or punts.

“I just don’t‘think we were ready to
play against them,” said Pitt senior cen-
ter Jeff McCurley, who also stated that
the North Carolina defensive line may
have been the best Pitt has been up
against this season.

The Tar Heels first got their hands
on Turman on Pitt’s second possession
of the game in the first quarter.

Following a 17-yard rush by Kevan

Barlow, Pitt had good ﬁeld position
with a first down on the North Carolina
28-yard line. On the very next play,
Turman was sacked for a 7-yard loss by
Chris Bender. Pitt had to settle for a 39-
yard ﬁeld goal by Nick Lotz, which put
the Panthers up 3-0.

Later in the first quarter, the Tar
Heels got on the scoreboard when
Willie Parker ran the ball in from 8
yards out. The extra point was good,
and North Carolina went up 7-3.’

On Pitt’s ensuing drive, Turman
was dropped for a 10-yard loss on first
down by Julius Peppers. Add to that a
false start penalty for 5 yards on the fol-
lowing play, and Pitt could not get out
of its 25-yard hole and was forced to
punt. North Carolina got a ﬁeld goal on
the possession padding their lead to 10-
3. '

After Antonio Bryant’s 84-yard
touchdown reception evened up the
game at 10 and a 32-yard ﬁeld goal put
the Tar Heels up 13-10, Pitt’s last drive
of the first half produced a familiar
result against the Tar Heels’ defense,
with Turman being pounded to the
ground and no points being scored for
Pitt. Peppers and Anthony Perkins col-
laborated on the 5-yard sack of Turman.

Turman looked to pass on the ﬁnal
down of the first half, but he was
thwarted again when defensive tackle
Ryan Sims batted the ball away.

Priestley entered the picture in the
second half with Turman sitting out
because of dehydration, and he soon felt
the same‘ effect from the line that
Turman did.

The fourth quarter got off to a
rough start for the Panthers when

Priestley fumbled the ball after being
sacked by Sedrick Hodge, and North
Carolina recovered. 3

Late in the game, after battling back
to just a three-point deﬁcit, Pitt shut

down North Carolina and had one more '

set of downs to try and win the game.

After three incomplete passes,
Priestley was sacked for a 10-yard loss
by Peppers, and Pitt had to turn the ball
over on downs to the Tar Heels, who
ran out the clock for the 20-17_ victory.

In the end, the most telling statistic
of the game may have been the six
sacks, three of which Peppers had a
hand in.

Two of the sacks resulted in points
for the Tar Heels on the following pos-
sessions, and the last ended the chances
of Pitt being eligible for a bowl game
for another week. A

“They just physically manhan_dled
us for a little while,” Harris said. “For a
good measure of the game, they made it
real difficult to throw the ball.”

game. I

Pitt had 29 minutes to try to tie the
game. The best scoring chance for the
Panthers came when Veltri was mov-
ing down the left sideline with the ball
and dropped it off for Clay Haﬂich.

Haﬂich blasted a shot that was tipped j

just wide of the goal by McDonald.

“We had our chances and we did- '

n’t ‘capitalize early in the game,”
Luxbacher said.

On paper it looked as if the
Panthers and the Pirates might have

* one of the higher-scoring games of the

tournament. The two teams met earli-
er in the year, with Pitt winning, 4-3.
Seton Hall is the highest-scoring team
in the conference, but Luxbacher said

. he knew it would be a low scoring

game. 1

“In tournament play, things tight-
en up a little bit,” Luxbacher said. “I
told the kids that the score would be
2-1, but'I just didn’t know which way

‘ it would go.” «

There were six Panthers who
played the final game of their careers
in the loss. Luxbacher expressed his

. pain for those players after the game.

“I feel bad for the seniors,”

I Luxbacher said. “I just wish‘ they

could have gone out in a better way.”
. Although the season ended-with a
[tough loss, Luxbacher said he was
still very happy with the way the 2000
season went for his team.
“It was a hard-fought game, and
we lost. But now its over,” Luxbacher
said. “I’m still very - proud of these

, guys. This is a helluva group of guys.”

Seton Hall coach Manfred
Schellscheidt was also impressed with
the performance of the Panthers.

“I’ve’been coaching for 13 years,
and this is the best Pitt team I’ve
faced,” Schellscheidt said.
