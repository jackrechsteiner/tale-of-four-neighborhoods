-. ALAN SIPRESS & STEVEN MUFSON
A ‘ The Washington Post

WASHINGTON — The Bush admin-
istration moved aggressively Wednesday to
lay the diplomatic and military groundwork
for a possible strike against Osama bin
Laden and his supporters in Afghanistan,
winning an unprecedented NATO commit-
ment of support and pressuring neighboring
Pakistan for intelligence and logistical back-
ing. .

As dawn was breaking Wednesday on
the ﬁrst day after the gravest terrorist assault
in American history, President Bush and his
top diplomats were already lining up support
across Europe, the Middle East and Asia for
a response that ﬂiey said would not just
apprehend the attackers but retaliate against

, any countries behind them.

Secretary of State Colin Powell spoke

T  early% Wednesday morning with NATO T

Secretary General George Robertson and by
the end of the day had won a declaration
committing the  to back an American

r retaliation

military reprisal. Powell said the declaration
would “tee up” the invocation of the NATO

charter’s mutual defense clause for the ﬁrst»

‘ time in the alliance’s 52-year history, assur-
ing the United States of overﬂight rights and
other forms of support if the administration

concluded the terrorist attacks came from .

abroad. .

After a Wednesday morning meeting
with his national security advisers, Bush
called the attacks on the World Trade Center
and Pentagon “acts of war.” Congress swift-
ly adopted a joint resolution that ofﬁcials
from both Capitol Hill and the administra-
tion said freed the White House from having
to seek a formal declaration of war.

U.S. ofﬁcials also began high-level
meetings with officials from Pakistan to
insist on their help in tracldng the attackers
and aiding a retaliatory strike. The Pakistan
government has long had close ties with the
Taliban movement in Afghanistan that shel-
ters bin Laden.

Brijesh Shah found himself the center of

   attentiofn whenever he walked past trafﬁc
I ' -lights Tuesday night. '

“If you’re walking on a sidewalk and

; people are at a red light, instead of staring

ahead, they are staring at you,” he said.
_ Shah, a member of the Indian Student
Association, said he felt safe because on
. Tuesday there was extra security on campus.
“But had it been another night, I might
not have,” he added. I

Maher Hoque, a Bangledeshi student ,

who is also a member of the Indian Student
Association, said his parents called “like
eight times  the bombing. They said

don’t go out by yourse .” I.

“So I stayed at home. I deﬁnitely did not
feel like going out at all that night,” he said.

Hindu Student Council - president
Ashish Mitra said that friends had com-
plained to him about being stared at and ver-
bally harassed.

“Tivo of my friends, when they arrived
at the prayer vigil at Heinz Chapel, they felt

-so many pairs of eyes staring at them that

they had to leave,” he said. '

The harassment stems from Tuesday’s
terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center
towers and the Pentagon, and the media’s
linking of the strikes to Islamic fundamental-

ist groups and terrorists such as Osarna'bin '

Laden, who has ties to Afghanistan and the
Middle East.

Some (students who appear foreign or
have darker complexions have been the vic-
tims of harassment, regardless of their
nationality, ethnicity or religion. For exam-
ple, though India and Bangladesh have not
been associated with.-the attacks, students
such as Shah and Hoque have been the tar-
gets of harassment. V

“When something like this happens, it’s

common in U.S. history to ﬁnd a scapegoat,”

student Sharyl‘ Mathai said.

“People are seeing a brown-skinned
person, and they automatically assume that
they are responsible,” student Erika Strauss
said.

(U-WIRE) WASHINGTON —

_College students across the country

experienced a full tumult of emotions
from shock, horror and disbelief as
they watched images of the unprece-
dented terrorist attacks on New York
and Washington Tuesday.
°' The leveling of the World Trade
Center in New York and part of
Washington’s Pentagon shook the
campuses of approximately 15 rnil-
lion students causing numerous uni-
versities to cancel classes and hold
vigils. Students huddled in front of
television sets watching news reports
that looked more like movies than
reality. '
“You just kind of stare at the TV
and try to figure out if you are looking

at a movie or not,” said University of _

Pennsylvania senior Andrew Glaser.
Students . across the country echoed
those sentiments,’ staring at images in

' disbelief.

“It was an absolutely surreal
scene,” said Michael Mirer, editor-in-
chief of the Columbia University
Daily Spectator. “One day I’ll be able
to put it into words _— but not today.”

University in'Washington were unable
to contact loved ones via telephone in
the hours after the attack as cell phone
cells and ground lines were jammed.
Roads and bridges leading into and
out of the capital were closed initially
following the incidents.

“I don’t want to sleep in the city
tonight, but I don’t know where to go
or have a way to get there,” said GW
sophomore Mackenzie Liman.

“I don’t know how many of these
terrorist acts I can take before I decide
to transfer,” said GW sophomore ‘and
Boston native Lars Bildman. “I don’t

want to put myself or my parents
through this type of stress, if this con-
tinues.”

Students predicted that Tuesday’s
events could be the defining moment
of their generation.‘

“This the Pearl Harbor, the [John
F. Kennedy] assassination of our gen-
eration,” said , Brown University
freshman Dan Mortensen

Only hours after the attack, stu-
dents were speculating on what
actions the United States might take.

“I feel like this could spark a third
world war,” said University of New

Mexico student Coery Mello. “This is ,
unlike anything we’ve ever seen. The ‘

response has to be strong and swift.

We can’t just sit back and take such a

The Pitt News

Securing a basketball under one
arm, freshman Jon Hill reached into
his crumpled plastic bag and pulled
out a handful of yellow ribbons.

“Do you want a ribbon?” he
asked McCormick Hall passersby

yesterday afternoon.

With little response, he tried
again.
“Support America and wear a

I ribbon,” he urged.

Some Pitt students and employ-
ees were more receptive than others.
Regardless of the few who
expressed apathy, Hill said it made
him feel good to honor the thou-
sands of lives lost in Tuesday’s ter-
rorist attacks. He encouraged peo-
ple to wear his handmade yellow
ribbons for the cause.

“I truly like to help,” Hill said.

With $6.35 and some spare time,
Hill made a trip to a local drugstore
for yellow gift ribbon and a box of
400 pins. He pieced his craft togeth-
er on the Schenley Quad curb.

not familiar with the bus system or

the Downtown area, where the near-

est blood bank is located.

As an alternative, he wore a rib-
bon yesterday morning. When stu-
dents asked him where they could
get their own, he decided he would
make more.

Hill said that he hoped the rib-

bons would promote national pride

and raise spirits around campus.

“America might get a bad repu-
tation sometimes, but there are a lot
of people who care,” he said.

His patriotism is a trait that Hill
attributes to his father, a Vietnam
War veteran, and to his mother, who
was originally from Thailand. He
said that people don’t realize how
good they have it in America.

Students from all walks of cam-

pus life pinned H_ill’s ribbons to ,

their shirts and school bags. Some
came back to him for seconds, like
Bettina Lynch, a Pitt security guard
who wanted more for her office-
mates. I

University Senate meeting opens, closes in remembrance

KRISTEN DRANK .
The Pitt News

A moment of silence for those who witnessed the
unspeakable horror of Sept. 11 adjourned the University
Senate’s ﬁrst meeting of the academic year at Heinz Chapel.

Led by Chancellor Mark Nordenberg and Senate
President James Cassing, administrators, faculty and stu-
dents walked from Posvar Hall to Heinz Chapel to pay their
respects to those who lost their lives.

“I express regret for this national tragedy and sorrow to
the victims and their families,” Nordenberg said

Cassing, newly elected to the University Senate,
opened the meeting with the same sentiments.

“On his somber occasion it’s a pity what happened and
it should remind us what we are about as a University,” he
said “We’re the good guys.”

After the opening remarks, Nordenberg asked that a
moment of silence be observed for former Chancellor
Wesley W. Posvar and history professor Michael Jimenez
who recently passed away. A memorial service for Posvar
will be held on Sept. 24 at 3 pm. at Heinz Chapel.

Nordenberg said that it was a busy summer with the
passing of budgets and the engagement in a number of spe-

cial instructive initiatives such as the Howard Hughes
Research Camp. '

The academic year started well with a growing number
of eager participants in the freshmen convocation ceremony
and Lantern Night, Nordenberg said. He also extended his
gratitude to the smdent body for their contribution of the
panther statue.

“I quite like it. It’s a wonderful emblem in my opin-
ion,” Cassing said. .

Science Odyssey 2001, a 2 1/2-day symposium initiat-
ed by Dr. Arthur Levine to showcase new themes in ,current
research, is still taking place, but because of restrictions on
air travel, some speakers will be unable to attend. .

All intercollegiate athletics were also canceled until fur-
ther notice, Nordenberg said, which seems to be “part of a
national trend” in that most colleges. and universities are
doing the same. . ‘

Cassing armounced that the Faculty Assembly is now

working with new members and student representatives in I

establishing agenda.

“We are able to talk about what the University of
Pittsburgh does but also what other universities do as well,”
Cassing said

Jeff Alex, president of the Student Government Board,

extended his condolences for the tragic events of Tuesday

‘and congratulated the new council oﬂicers. ‘Alex said that

the major focus of SGB this year would be to tackle issues
of ﬁnancial aid, on-campus transportation and to continue

' the goals oflastyear’sboard. c

Alex also acknowledged the success of several activi-
ties already held this year such as Arrival Survival, the activ-
ities fair and the panther unveiling.

“I can assure you it’s not going anywhere,” he said of
the panther. A

Curtis - Wadsworth, the . president of the Graduate
Professional Student Association said that the group’s_ goal
this year is to build more graduate student involvement by
looking to start a  .

Barbara Mowery, president of the Stalf Association
Council, armounced that there will be a ﬂea market held on

Sept. 29, donations from which will be given to. the ‘book

ftmd for the children of staﬁ.

Nordenberg then asked everyone attending ﬂre meeting"

to follow him and Cassing to Heinz Chapel for a moment of
silence as they adjourned. p

“As we learn more about the tragic events, I know
sortie people will-be counting on us to be a source of com-

. fort,” he said. ; .

Top firefighters
among hundreds
dead in New York

WILLIAM MURPHY & ELIZABETH MOORE
Newsday

NEW YORK — New York City’s ﬁre
department apparently lost some of the
best of its ranks when the towers"of the
World Trade Center collapsed Tuesday
morning after being rammed by two
planes.

More than 300 ﬁreﬁghters were miss-
ing, but Mayor Rudolph Giuliani con-
ﬁrmed only the deaths of some of its top
commanders:

- William Feehan of Queens, the ﬁrst
deputy ﬁre commissioner, and the second-
in-comrnand to Fire Commissioner Tom
Von Essen. -

0 Peter J. Ganci Jr., the chief of the
department and its highest—ranking uni-
formed ofﬁcer.

- The Rev. Mychal Judge, a Catholic
chaplain who often presides at funeral
masses for ﬁreﬁghters.

- Capt. Raymond Downey of Deer
Park, N.Y., a well—known expert on search
and rescue who led the city’s team to help
Oklahoma City after its federal building
was bombed in 1995.

The extent of the losses were stagger-
ing. Von Essen said still missing were all

James Boyle, former head of the
Uniformed Fireﬁghters Association, said
his son, Michael, was among the missing.

Michael had been scheduled to get off

Boyle said he found out when he got to his
son’s ﬁrehouse and saw his son’s car out-
side and his civilian clothes in his locker.

Financial markets of growing concern

‘ Jerry Knight
The Washington Post

Easing fears that the stock prices will
plummet as soon as the U.S. markets
reopen, European ﬁnancial markets stabi-
lized Wednesday and world economic
leaders vowed to limit the ﬁnancial fallout
from the World Trade Center tragedy.

Richard Grasso said that bond trading‘

would resume today but the stock market
would remain closed at least one more
day- .

possible is intended to reassure investors
that Tuesday’s deadly terrorist attacks on

the nation’s military and ﬁnancial com-
mand centers won’t become an economic
disaster.

“Our’nation’s ﬁnancial markets are
strong and resilient,” intoned Treasury
Secretary Paul O’Neill, who cut short a
trip to Tokyo to return to Washington.

That theme was repeated in a state-
ment issued on behalf of the world’s seven

wealthiest nations, promising “that this
tragedy will not be compounded by dis-'

ruption to the global economy.”

The Federal Reserve and its counter-
parts in the other six nations said they will
pump money into their economies to_ help
ward off a worldwide recession.

The United States and many other C

nations were on the brink of recession

before the suicide bombings, and econo- V

mists worry that the world could be
pushed over the edge by the ﬁscal and
psychological wounds of Tuesdayfs
attack

Wednesday morning, Midway
Airlines said it has been pushed over the

edge and is suspending all ﬂight opera-

tions effective immediately.

Midway ﬁled for reorganization in
bankruptcy three weeks ago but now says
there. is little prospect it can keep ﬂying
given what’s likely to happen to airline
travel.

foiled fourth
plane’s attack

CHARLES LANE
The Washington Post

. As United Airlines Flight 93 entered its
last desperate moments aloft, there was ter-
ror and violence on board -— but also hero'-
ism.

Minutes before the giant airliner
smashed into aﬁeld southeast of Pittsburgh,
passenger Jeremy Glick used a cell phone to
call his wife at home in New Jersey and told
her that he and several other people on board

hadcomeupwithaplantoresisttheterror--

ists who had hijacked the plane, according to
Glick’s brother-in—law, Douglas Hurwitt.

“They were going to stop whoever it
was from doing what whatever it was they’ d
plann ” Hurwitt said. “He knew that stop-
ping them was going to end all of their lives.
But that was my broﬂier-in-law. He was a
take—charge guy.”

Anticipating his own death, Glick, who
celebrated his 31st birthday on Sept. 3, told
his wife, Lyzbeth, that he hoped she would
have a good life and would take care of their
three-month old baby girl, Hurwitt said.

- Glick explained to his wife that the
plane had been taken over by three Middle
Eastem men wearing red headbands. The
terrorists, wielding knives and brandishing a

red box they claimed contained a bomb, .

ordered the passengers, pilots and ﬂight
attendants toward the rear of the plane, then
took over the cockpit. '

The story of Glick’s words adds to the
account of passenger resistance already
given by another passenger’s mother 'on
NBC’s Today show Wednesday morning.
Alice Hoglan of  said her son,
MarkBingham, alsospokeofaplantotack-

Ie the hijackers in a last—minute cell-phone 

call to her. L

Flight 93 was the only one of four
hijacked planes that did not smash into a
major targeton‘ the ground, and some oﬂi-
cials are already saying that the actions of
people on board may have prevented an
even greater tragedy. ’ _

Pennsylvania Rep. John Murtha; the
ranking Democrat on the Congressional
Defense Appropriations Cormnittee, said at
the crash site that he believes a struggle took

p place in the plane’s cockpit and that the '
plane was headed for a  target in

America prepares to retaliate against large-scale terrorist assault

Retaliation, page 1 .

clearly a worldwide momentum right now
to stand up and be counted. Whose side are
you on terrorism?” a senior State
Department ofﬁcial said. .
Powell said he’d already held several
conversations with leaders from Saudi
Arabia, who would have to give the go-
ahead for the United States to use their cru-
cial bases "as staging grounds for any move

against bin Laden. But he left unclear F

whether he’d secured Saudi agreement. “If
they can be helpful in ﬁnding those who
may be responsible, we will expect that help
and we will express that very, very clearly,”
Powell said.

As the country talked of war, Powell
moved well beyond his pledge on Tuesday
to bring the attackers to justice. '

“It’s going after and dealing with the
sources of support ﬂiat they have, whether
that "source of support might come from a
host country or other organizations that pro-
videthem,” Powell told reporters. “We have

-to make sure ﬂiat we go after terrorism and
get it by its branch and root.”

He vowed the United States would hold
accountable any country offering support to
terrorists involved in the attack He singled
out the radical Taliban movement ruling
Afghanistan for providing “protection,
opportunity, facilities” to bin Laden, stop-
ping short of explicitly blaming-bin Laden’s
al-Qaeda organization for Tuesday’s mas-

sacres.
Powell cautioned that a U.S. strike
would not come within the next few days
since it would require time to ﬁnd the prop-
er targets and put American forces in place.
Bush spoke Wednesday with British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, French President

‘Jacques Chirac, Chinese President Jiang

Zemin and twice with Russian President
Vladimir Putin — covering all permanent

members of the‘UN. Security Council — as

well as other leaders.

White ‘House spokesman Ari Fleischer
said in the conversations between Bush and
Putin, “the two presidents agreed‘ that they
would work closely together in the coming
weeks to ﬁght those responsible for yester-
day’s acts of terrorism.” A

China, for its part, has close relations
with Pakistan and recently signed an eco-
nomic development accord with the Taliban,
but it also fears terrorist attacks, especially in
its largely Muslim Xinjiang province.

Powell spoke with more world leaders,
including’ Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon, Palestinian chairman Yasser Arafat,
U.N. Secretary General Koﬁ Annan,
European Union foreign policy chief Javier
Solana and Foreign Minister Louis Michel
of Belgium, which currently holds the EU’s
rotating presidency.

To build support in the Muslim world,
where Tuesday’s attacks have been applaud-
ed in some quarters, Powell spoke with lead-
ers from the Arab League, Jordan and Saudi

Arabia, ofﬁcials said.

But it’s Pakistan and its tangled rela-
tionship with the Taliban that have emerged
as a crucial focus of U.S. planning and diplo-

‘ macy. Pakistan, a historic American ally, has ‘

previously given lip service to efforts to ﬁnd
bin Laden, but offered little tangible assis-
tance despite U.S. pressure, U.S. ofﬁcials
said. '

Deputy Secretary of State Richard
Armitage and other senior State Deparnnent
ﬁgures met Wednesday with Pakistani ofﬁ—
cials, including Pakistani intelligence chief
Lt. Gen. Mahmood Ahmed, who was in
Washington for a visit scheduled before the
attacks.

“There was an extremely candid
exchange from our side, one that left little
room for misunderstanding,” an administ:ra-
tion ofﬁcial said. “It is safe to say therules
have changed. They changed yesterday.”

Holding .. out the possibility of an
American attack in the immediate area of
Pakistan, Powell said the United States is
also interested in ‘how helpful they might be
if we ﬁnd a basis to act upon that informa-
tion.” ’ ‘

Pakistan’s ambassador in Washington,
Maleeha Lodhi, said she gave Armitage a
message from Musharraf assuring the
United States of “Pakistan’s unstinted coop-
eration in the ﬁght against terrorism.”

A military campaign in the remote

P mountains of Afghanistan would confront
daunting challenges —— in particular, intimi-

dating terrain and ﬁerce local ﬁghters.

The Bush‘ administration would also
face the issue of the legality of mounting a
military init:_iat:ive against a private militant

organization rather than another country.

Attorney George Terwilliger, the
deputy attorney general in the ﬁrst Bush
administration who remains close to the cur-
rent White House, said White House and

Department of Justice lawyers are research- '

ing the extent of presidential authority to
order assassinations. ,

They are reviewing whether “the presi-
dent has authority without a congressional
resolution to use force against civilians

rather than a government or military instal- .

lation when there is a demonstrable and
imminent threat.” _
Amid the calls and preparations for
reprisals, there were some voices of caution.
Brent Scowcroft, who was national security

adviser during the Gulf War, said the United ‘
States needed to avoid hitting the wrong tar- .

gets, as the Clinton administration did in
1998 when it bombed a pharmaceutical
plant in Sudan and an empty militant camp
in Afghanistan after bin Laden associates
allegedly bombed U.S. Embassies in Kenya
and Tanzania.

“There’s going to be tremendous pres-
sure for early action, and I think that’s the

' president’s inclination,” Scowcroft said.

“But  you need to make sure you know
what you’re doing” or, he warned, the
administration would risk looking “silly.”

    EDITORIAL

Our campus, our generation must
come together in wake of tragedy

Every generation has its deﬁning
moment, a tragedy that unites people of all
different creeds and colors. For our genera-
tion, the deﬁning event occurred Tuesday
when terrorists hijacked four planes and
crashed them into the World Trade Center,
the Pentagon and a ﬁeld outside Somerset,
Pa.

For the rest of our lives, we will
remember what we were doing when we
ﬁrst heard about the attacks. Sept. 11, 2001,
will be to us what Dec. 7, 1941, is to our
grandparents’ generation and what Nov. 22,
1963, is to our parents’ generation.

Our ﬁrst reaction is to grieve for those
who were affected and their loved ones.
Tuesday we felt what they felt. The people
on the planes, in the twin towers and in the
Pentagon immediately became our brothers
and sisters. Whether or not we directly
knew them, we feel grief, we feel loss.

For our generation, this is the end of
innocence. We came of age at the end of the
Cold War. In our schools, we faced only ﬁre
and tornado drills. We never thought our
existence could end in an instant.

By the time we were old enough to
understand politics, the Soviet Union was
no longer the Evil Empire.

We got a bit older and it collapsed. We
were the only superpower. '

We won the Gulf War in less than two
months in 1991.

The World Trade Center was bombed
in 1993. But we never felt this threatened.

The Alfred Murrah Federal Building
was bombed in 1995. But we never felt this
threatened. '

America was invincible.

Tuesday we felt our existence threat-
ened for the ﬁrst time. We felt America’s
invincibility collapsing with those towers.

We had felt insulated. Never had the
national news affected us so personally. No
matter who won the presidential election, no
matter who controlled oil in the Middle

East, we knew our lives would not change I

in dramatic, permanent ways. Tuesday
eroded that insulation.

religions, genders, races and political beliefs
unite to comfort each other.

Our campus + a large, urban, disparate
campus — must come together.

After the news broke, our campus
mobilized in an effort to seek unity in a time
of need. Counselors were ready to console
students. Support groups have already
formed. We have shared our feelings, and
strangers have listened.

But we have not come together as we
need to.

Even Congress, the model of petty
bickering, has united. Tuesday night,
Congress held a press conference on the
Capitol steps and sang \ “God Bless
America” in unison. Republican, Democrat
and Independent came together to share in
our grief as a nation.

Educators have thrown aside their cur-
ricula and asked their students to discuss
their feelings. Many professors have left the
ivory tower and discussed the events in the
context of their ﬁelds. Whether it be archi-
tecture, history, ﬁnance or politics, students
are learning new contexts in which to see
Tuesday’s events.

hr the next several days, we must be
even more considerate of others. We never
know what our neighbors or classmates
may be feeling. They never know what we
are feeling. We never know who lost a rela-
tive, a friend. We must respond with a level
of sensitivity and kindness that surpasses the
cool politeness that normally characterizes
our daily interactions.

We must strike a balance between
returning to normalcy and dealing with the
trauma. Now is a time for both.

The United States of America will con-
tinue.

Tuesday our generation felt threatened
for the ﬁrst time.

But we will persist.

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 2001 

America was glued to television sets
yesterday, watching the carnage unfold.

Planes crashed, landmarks tumbled
and trademark American confidence
shaken. V

It’s natural for us to want to blame
someone. We want someone to take
responsibility for the death and destruc-
tion. If we have a face and a motive to
attach to the Violence, we feel like
there’s a chance we might be

Pursuing a culprit, not a scapegoat

_ a parking lot.

We are afraid and ‘angry.

And from that fear and anger comes
calls for violence. '

We want to hurt. To hit and punch
and bomb and destroy until the pain of
our experience is somehow lessened and
our dignity and reputation as a super-
power is restored.

But we can’t create an enemy. It’s
_ not easy to have an

able to understand it all.

But we don’t know
Whom to blame. Facts are
trickling in slowly and emo-
tions are flying high, so
we’re looking for a scape-
goat.

Because of the previous
incident at the World Trade
Center and stereotypes that
many people harbor, blame

unreachable foe, but creat-
ing an enemy ——
. Muslims of the world — so
that we have someone to
fight is not what my
America does.

We need to zero in on
the people who committed
this crime and those who
helped them do it, and we
need to remember a most

 

seems to be settling on the
Muslim population of the world.

But there’s something important we .

need to remember.

If the hijackers were Muslim funda-
mentalists, if they were ﬁnanced by
Osama bin Laden and if they killed
themselves and thousands of others to
prove a point about American foreign
policy, they did not do it because Islam
told them to.

Already, the anti-Arab sentiment is
emerging. A man on the news screams
for Arab Muslims, some of whom must
have lived here longer than he has, to go
“home.” Muslim women, as reported in
Tuesday’s New York Times, are afraid
to leave their houses. Muslim schools
shut down. Crowds of angry people
harass shop owners, and there are calls
to turn Afghanistan, the country
assumed to be harboring bin Laden, into

important fact.

Violence is not a facet of Islam.

We react viscerally to photographs
and ﬁlm of people falling from build-
ings and victims covered in blood, but
true Islam preaches peace.

The Koran, the holy book of Islam,
tells Muslims that killing is wrong.
Killing one innocent person, it says, is
akin.to killing all of humanity.

In Islam a person who commits sui-
cide goes to hell. The Koran says it,

‘ well-educated religious leaders say it.

The problem, then, is with a small but
inﬂuential faction of uneducated reli-
gious leaders who harbor hidden politi__-
cal agendas. .

I can’t speculate as to those agen-
das; I don’t pretend to understand them.
But it is crucial for us to remember that

If a person of African descent is dri-
ving an expensive car in a drug—infested
neighborhood, ‘what should the police

conclude?

If a person of Middle Eastern descent
is in an airport with lots of luggage, what
should airport security conclude?

If a person of Italian descent is in
trouble with the law, what should the
police conclude?

If you were to play the role of police
or security, what would you conclude?

Your answer to these questions deter-
mines your understanding of racial proﬁl-
ing and stereotyping.

My answer is that no conclusion
should be made about any individual —
regardless of ethnicity — without first
examining all the facts.

B-ut why would I even ask those

' questions?

I ask because usually these questions
elicit responses that stereotype these
groups. While these are not the only
groups that have been stereotyped nega-
tively, they provide a good example.

It can be easy to racially proﬁle and
stereotype an entire ethnicity’ when an
individual or group commits a crime.

When you are an innocent target of’

hate and anger because people perceive
you in a stereotypical way, it canbe very
frustrating and hurtful. I know because I
have been in that situation.

The tragedies that occurred in New
York, Washington and Somerset County
made me teary-eyed while at work. I felt

~ pain for those who lost lovedones.

Yet when people walked by me, I
could feel negative emotions coming

from them as if they thought I was ’

responsible.

When I was about to ﬁnish my‘ work
for the day, a black person came up to me,
pointed his ﬁnger right in _my face and
told me I should get my people out of this
country. I was totally speechless for a few
seconds after hearing him say these
remarks right in. front of other people.

I ﬁnally responded by saying that as
a black person he should know better than
to racially proﬁle people in this way. I
was especially upset that he autori1atical-

ly concluded I was of Middle Eastern 

descent and made the cutting remarks that

. he did.

For those who don’t know, I am
Indian — but have been perceived as

Thursday, September 13," 2001

being Middle Eastern. A couple of years
ago, I was at an interfaith discussion
group where one of the leaders perceived
me as a Muslim, although I am a follow-

er of Christ. That did not bother me much._

But when a war or act of terrorism
occurs and you are — or are perceived to
be —— Middle Eastern, it is not a pleasant
experience. , ‘ "

. Even if I were a person of Middle
Eastern descent, I still would have
thought it wrong to automatically associ-
ate me with those Middle Eastemers who
allegedly committed the acts of terrorism
against the United States. I hope innocent
people do not suffer because of their eth-
nicity. Yesterday, a student told me that
a person told her she was responsible for
the bombing just because of her ethnicity.

These remarks affected me so much

that a friend, who is also my boss, gave

me his home phone number in case I
needed to talk, and I also went to New
Hope Christian Community in Oakland

\

to speak and pray with my pastor and ’

other brothers and _sisters in Christ.

At another job I held a few years ago, I

a manager would insinuate that I had a
bomb with me and was planning on
blowing everyone up whenever he saw

me simply carrying a box. I would ignore . ,

his remarks, but one day another emp1oy- ,

if ee cared enough to report the manager for

this behavior.

The people of a majority race are not
as aﬁected by racial profiling as are peo-
ple of minority races.

As tragic and heinous as the attack on

the United States was, are we willing to .

make all Middle Eastern people pay the
price?

of Middle Eastern descent and totally
innocent. They need your support, not
your ridicule. _

A friend of mine told me his cousin
committed suicide in the 1950s at age 18

1 A lot of students on this campus are”

because of taunting from American stu- ‘

dents. The reason: He was Japanese and

being ridiculed as “retaliation” for Pearl
Harbor.

. Whenever a tragic event occurs,
more irmocent people should not suffer.
These next few days, you are the one who

could make a difference in the lives of

others. ,
_ Let’s make sure no one has to be
ashamed because of his or her ethnicity.

Letters to the editor

Administrators respond to events

Chancellor: Life is fragile

Stop and consider! Life is butva day;
A fragile dew-drop on its perilous way . ..
(from “Sleep and Poetry” by John Keats)

Yesterday we all were reminded
in the most terrible way, of life’s
fragile nature. For mostof us, as
the news arrived from New York
and Washington and Somerset, it
produced a state of disbelief.

We were stunned that our
nation’s security systems could be
breached so effectively. We simply
could not comprehend the magni-
tude of the carnage and destruction.
Perhaps more than anything, we
were shocked that human beings
could deliberately and coldly inflict
this kind of suffering on others.

It seems very unlikely that
those initial feelings will be

_ changed by the arrival of new infor-

mation. From what we now know,
when _a final death toll is released
and other damage is quantified, the
staggering size of the numbers
almost certainly will make this
tragedy even more incomprehensi-

ble. And, given those_,numbers, as

the news becomes , more specific,
members of our University commu-

' nity almost certainly will be per-

sonally touched by the tragedy, fur-
ther deepening our collective sense
of loss.

In the midst of yesterday’s
unfolding crisis, it was concern for
others that characterized this com-
munity. Certainly, that was true of
the members of the University’s
staff. Capable and» dedicated mem-
bers of this group quickly mobi-
lized. Over the course of the day

and through the evening, they
worked to upgrade security, to
ensure that there was a smooth
sharing of available information, to
provide comfort and counseling to
those who needed it and to ensure
that essential services continued to
be delivered to our students. _

A selfless focus on the needs of
others also was characteristic of our
students. Even as the events of the
morning were unfolding, small
groups of students periodically
came to my office, and I later talked
to others on campus. Particularly
after the plane crash in
Southwestern Pennsylvania, stu-
dents had some reason to be appre-
hensive for their own safety.
However, in conversations with me
and with others, what they wanted
most to know was how they could
be of help, especially to people in
the Pitt community with loved ‘ones
who lived or worked near any of the
disaster sites.

The fact that the absence of
humanity in some could bring out
the most generous of human quali-
ties in others is one of life’s great
ironies. Looking forward, it also is
our greatest source of hope.

Today, we return to what might

be called “normal” routines under"

the most abnormal of circum-
stances. For the foreseeable future,
there will be regular and graphic

”reminders of the horrors of Sept.

11, 2001, as well as commentaries
on how those destructive events
have permanently changed our
lives. Presumably, there will be
ways for some of us to be of help to
those dealing most directly with the
tragedies, and we clearly should
offer whatever assistance we can.

And as we move forward with
our own lives, we all should do so
with a renewed sense of commit-
ment to civility and to community.
Our actions should reﬂect the fact
that we care ‘about and respect each
other. We should listen to and try to
understand differing points of view.
We should actively pursue ways of
resolving conﬂicts that ultimately
strengthen, rather than destroy, our
common bonds and that elevate,
rather than demean, our humanity.

In a sense, there can be no silver
lining, in a cloud as dark as the one
that cast its long shadow across
America yesterday. But there are
lessons that can be taken even from
such a terrible experience. And
those lessons, if we embrace them
today and consistently apply them
in the future, can make this commu-
nity, this country, and even this
world, better places.

Now is the time for

student learning, civility

I‘ want to thank our students for ~

the responsible ways in which they
conducted themselves during our
nation’s crisis. As the outcomes of
our shared tragedy continue _ to
unfold, it is of critical importance
that our students continue to prac-
tice the highest levels of civility as
members of our diverse University
community. ,

For example, now is the time for
our residence halls’ members to
engage in the best forms of living

and learning, utilizing this most

unfortunate but teachable moment.
Now is the time to use our wonder-

,ful gift of reason to enhance, not

tear asunder our human capacities.
Now is the time to shed light, not
add to the darkness recently creat-
ed. _ ‘ I

Now is the time for every stu-
dent to do their part in preventing
any ‘form of intolerance from exist-
ing on this campus.

react to
tragedy 8

Tenets of Islam misunderstood

First and foremost I would like to
offer my prayers to the unfathomable
number of victims that perished today
in New York, Washington, D.C., and
Somerset, Pa. Could anyone ever imag-
ine something of this magnitude hap-
pening? Especially here, on our soil, in
perhaps the world’s most inﬂuential
city.

I am personally astonished and out-
raged by whomever committed this
nefarious and heinous crime. What was
the message? I believe that the perpe-

trators of this massacre should be pun-

ished swiftly and justly.

I’m sure most of you feel the same
way I do at this point, but the reason
I’m writing this letter is to urge the stu-
dent body here at the University of
Pittsburgh to not lay blame on the
Muslims that have matriculated at this
wonderful University. I can assure you
that every one of us is just as hurt,
scared and angry as the rest of you. I
fear that because of this horrendous
incident that most of the Muslims here
will be deemed “guilty by association,
“ although not one of us is associated in
the least.

8 The initial thing that I would like to
point out is that the people responsible
for this are not Muslims, they may call
themselves Muslims and say that they
did this in the "name of God, but in no
way shape‘ or form are these people

Muslims. These people" are sick, .

demented, and according to the doc-
trines of Islam, will suffer the most dire
of consequences in the afterlife, just as
any other mass murderer would.

Islam is a monotheistic religion
based on peace and submitting to the
will of God. It is one that is fundamen-
tally the same as Christianity and
Judaism, the difference lying in subtle
details — not one that promotes vio-
lence and condemns people of another
faith or culture.

The terrorists who committed this
crime are insane. This man, Osarna bin
Laden, regardless of whether or not he
is guilty of this particular. crime, is a
lunatic. He has taken advantage of the

Letters, page 14

Letters, page 13

grave socioeconomic status of people
living in the Middle‘ East and given
them something to latch on to, just like
David Koresh in Waco, Tex. or Hitler

' in Nazi Germany.

These people have been brain-
washed. Bin Laden is completely delu-
sional if he thinks what he has done is

T’ the will of God. It angers me, and I’m

sure every other true Muslim in the
world, that he is desecrating Islam
with his statements. Afghanistan and
any nation that aids this man should
suffer the consequences for their
actions.

The entire country is experiencing
feelings of anguish, despair and anger
so acute that they may feel a need to

THE PITT NEWS

lash out and blame someone in imme-
diate proximity. I am urging everyone
on this campus to try and not blame or
ostracize the students here at the
University because they have a certain
skin color, a foreign name or are of a
particular religion. _

That is the exact opposite of what
should be done at this particular time.
We need to show the world that we are
in fact united as a country regardless of
religion, race, economic status and
age. We are all outraged by this
tragedy and need to stand together. So
please be tolerant. We are all
Americans and that bond should not be
broken.

Don’t let attacks damage our
democracy R

The world is certainly not the place I
thought it was just a day ago. The luxury to
which we Americans have become accus-
tomed, that of living our lives without fear
for them, is gone as ournaivete about the
nature of the world collapsed. The peace in
which we have believed ourselves to prosper
was never so peaceful at all. A

The world is indeed a different place
now, requiring a new perspective, new poli-
cies, new plans and understandings. Yet it is
important that we as Americans do not lose

sense of our values and ideals With which we-

have always hoped, with which we built this

_ great nation.

cy and freedom are built Our anger must not
be so base as to disenfranchise those whom
we condemn of due process.

I We must not stigmatize communities or
a people on the basis of ethnicity or national
origin. ‘

We must not attack the innocent nor »

seize upon the helplessness of the weak
We must not polarize the world along

the great continental rifts of religion or

beliefs.

Our justice must not be so swift as to
placate our lust for revenge and fan "even
greater the ﬁres of hatred and violence.

I write this to urge Americans to stand
strong and united against the forces of terror-
ism. We must not relinquish the freedom for
which we stand to a darkness devoid of the
light of reason. Americans in the face of such
a monumental tragedy must unite with ﬂue
citizens of the world regardless of the preju-
dices that have plagued humanity for gener-
ations. ’

In the dark days and months that follow,
we must not lose sight of our brothers and
sisters who stand equally alongside us, nor of
the torch of freedom that we each must carry.

racial tension here

Tensions, page 4

Student Government Board member and

member of the Black Action Society, lVlitra A A

and Rocco brainstormed ideas on how to
respond to the harassment that some stu-
dents were enduring.

Their plan of action included organiz-
ing a forum to be attended by representa-
tives of Residence Life, Student Volunteer
Outreach, the Office of International
Students, the University Center for
International Studies,;SGB, Pitt police and
student organizations whose constituents
may feel threatened. The meeting is at 6
p.m. tonight in 525 William Pitt Union.

At the meeting, Dworin, -‘lvlitra and
Rocco plan to discuss speciﬁc interventions
for ensuring campus safety. One idea is to
implement safety zones throughout campus,
places where students who are being threat-
ened or harassed can “take a timeout and
report the incident,” according to Mitra

A second plan is to start a student vol— I -

unteer escort service, in which volunteers
would be available to walk on or oil carn-

pus, or wait at bus stops, with students who"

feel threatened. ,

"Ihere were some of my friends who
did not want to come out of their apartments
today,” Mitra said.

Mitra said that his goal was “to make it.

aware that we will not stand for this kind of
thing on campus. These students deserve a

A safe campus as much as anyone.”

THE PITT NEWS I 15.

Finance analysts
consider attack’s
implications

Market, page 8

“Following the recent terrorist
attacks, demand for air transportation
is expected to decline sharply,”
Midway said. “We simply do not have
the resources necessary to permit us to
reorganize in this environment.”

Insurance companies around the
world offered assurance that they will
be able to make good on what are

i expected to be the biggest claims in

history. First—day estimates are that the
insurance carriers will have to pay out
$15 billion to $20 billion in property
damage, medical and life insurance
claims.

As the searing scenes of the twin
towers collapsing were replaced by the
ashen images of lower Manhattan
Wednesday, stocks recouped some of
their Tuesday losses. Germany’s DAX
stock index, which had plunged as
much as 10 percent, recovered more
than 2 percent today and London’s
FTSE index was up almost 3 percent.

The bounce back in European

stock prices encouraged hopes that ,

with a couple of days for investors to
catch their breath, the U.S. markets
will avoid panic selling when trading
does resume.
But recession remained the
biggest threat to the market.
a Almost every media outlet in
America Wednesday quoted Sung
Won Sohn, chief economist of Wells

' Fargo & Co.: “A full—b1own global

recession is highly likely.”

The most immediate economic
impact — which was cited by Midway
Airlines — is expected to be a drop in
air travel, which would quickly ripple
through the hotel, restaurant and rental
car businesses and every other busi-
ness that depends on travelers.
Already hit by __a stunning slump in
bookings in the past month, hotels and
airlines now will suffer from fear of
ﬂying.

Even more worrisome for the
economy is whether the shock, grief
and depression ‘produced by the horrif-

' ic bombing and the endless video

replays will dampen consumer confi-
dence and dry up the spending that has
kept the United.States out of recession.
At this point, the answer seems so
unavoidable that few economists felt it
necessary to look ahead to other possi-
bilities that could further depress the
urge to splurge: More terrorist attacks,
equally violent responses from the
United States and its military allies,
and disruption of Middle East energy
supplies. .
