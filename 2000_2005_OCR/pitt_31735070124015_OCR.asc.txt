senior and junior faculty,” said
James Knapp, associate dean for
Faculty Affairs in the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences (FAS). “We
haven’t been able to do that
in recentyears, "but. it is very
important for departments to
maintain a wide range of faculty
experience. _

“We hired some very distin-
guished faculty in chaired posi-
tions, and we also maintained
our recent.success in -hiring

 ore than 300 new pro-.

outstanding young faculty. We
are particularly pleased that 12
women, two Hispanic and three
African American faculty were
among the 25 new colleagues
hired so far this year.”

As a committed Christian
and a scholar whose interests
included quantum theory and
the philosophy of physics, Rob
Clifton was fascinated by the
interface between science and
faith. .

“He was a fan of C.S. Lewis
and liked to examine how the
scientiﬁc greats ——- Newton,
Einstein — regarded faith,” said
his wife, Marilyn. “He also liked
to teach philosophy of religion.
Vl/"ithout telling students where
he stood, all term he’d argue
hard for theism and just as hard
for atheism. At the end of the
term, he’d have the students
articulate their positions and he
would make his own position
clear as well.” ‘

Clifton, an associate professor
in Pitt’s philosophy department
with a secondary appointment in
the Department of -History and
Philosophy of Science, diedon
July 31, 2002, of colon cancer.
He was 38.

One of Clifton’s former doc-
toral students, Hans Halvorson,
remembered him as a successful,
passionate and proliﬁc researcher
and teacher who nonetheless
managed to set aside time for his
family. “I remember one of my
brainstorming sessions with Rob
because of its being combined
with parental duties. We met at
the Schenley ice rink so that he
could work with me.and take his
child skating all at once.”

Halvorson, currently an assis-
tant professor -of philosophy at

Princeton .University, added: ‘
“Rob will always be remembered _ ,

invphilosophical circles for his
predilection for collaborative
work. Most of his papers were
written with one or more co-

Rob Chfton
authors. VS/‘hat is less well known
is that, more often than not,
Rob did most of the work on
these papers.

_ “Being a co—author with Rob
was like receiving an honorary
degree. It was less a reﬂection
of your work done than of
Rob’s desire to share honor with
you.” 5

Halvorson recalled that when
he was feeling discouraged this
summer about his own career,
Clifton — evenjas he lay in a
bed in Shadyside Hospital —
e—mailed him: “PLEASE don’t

get so down about your, or.our,

' work (or its motivation). You’ve

chosen an absolutely exciting
career, mate.”

Clifton’s religious faith helped
to sustain him through his ﬁnal

illness, said his friend, VVilliam ‘

Rued, whom Clifton named
as his “spiritual adviser” this
summer to help him prepare
for death. “Rob had a very
high regard for the authority

Rob Clifton

 

of scripture, and he believed
that God intervened in human
affairs. He prayed for, and asked
others to pray for, a miracle of
healing for himself right upto
the end,” said Rued, who was
active for the last several years
with Clifton at the Church of the
Ascension in Oakland.

“As one friend put it, Rob was
ready to- die, he just didn’t want
to,” said Marilyn Clifton.

A Canadian citizen born in Ft.

,Erie, Ontario, Clifton received

a bachelor of science degree

in theoretical physics from A

the University of Waterloo in
1986 and a Ph.D. in history

and philosophy of science from ‘

Cambridge University in 1991.
He worked at Christ’s College

’ and the University of Western
Ontario before joining Pitt’s phi— ‘ i

losophy department in 1997.

Besides serving as an associate 1

professor here in the departments
ofphilosophyandthehistoryand
philosophy of science, Clifton
was associate director of Pitt’s

Center for Philosophy of Sci— -
ence. He also was editor—in— -

chief of the journal Studies
in History and Philosophy of
Modern Physics. .
Among the courses that Clif-
ton taught here were “Introduc-

tory Logic,” “Philosophy of -
/20th Century Physics” and

“Advanced Philosophy of Quan-
tum Mechanics.” ' .
In addition to his wife,.Mari-
lyn, Clifton is survived by his son
Ben, 9, and daughter Clare, 6.

UNIVERSITY SENATE

A problem regarding the University’s health
insurance beneﬁts looms less than a year from now.
I believe that considerations that should affect
the University’s de'cision—making concerning
thesebeneﬁts need to be widely assessed 
the University community‘. , ‘

Currently the University is in the third year
of a health beneﬁts contract with UPMC Health
   ' Plan that turned out to be fairly advantageous
for the University and its faculty and staff. The contract limited
premium increases in years two and three to a percentage
increase less than the percentage premium increases of many
employee health beneﬁts plans for those years. The problem
on the horizon exists because of two developments. One is the
rather large recent increases in the cost of health care and health
insurance premiums; the other is the commonwealth’s ﬁnancial
difﬁculties that have adversely affected state appropriations
to the University already, and are likely to continue in the
coming years’. ~ . . '

Some University representatives already have indicated that
the likely increase in premiums for 2003-2004 would be
in the vicinity of 25 percent over current premiums. The

University now pays varying percentages of employee health-

insurance premiums, based on the plan selected by the employee
(participant) and whether the participant is obtaining individual,

parent/child, husband/wife or family coverage. A participant’

who elects individual coverage under the HMO plan pays
nothingand the participant who selects individual coverage
under the Point—of—Service plan pays only "a small part of
the total premium. At the other end of the coverage options,

a participant purchasing family beneﬁts may pay as much’

‘as 30 percent of the total premiums for coverage under the
Point—of—Service plan. ,
Total health insurance premiums this year for the University’s
participating employeesprobablywill be between $32 million
and $33 million.-If premiums, on average, are to rise 25 percent,
thatwill mean the totalpremiums forv2003—2004 willbe around
$40 million and, because of ﬁnancial constraints caused in part
by little or no increase in the state appropriation, the allocation
of the increase in health insurance premiums, approximately

$8 million; between the faculty and_staf_f participants on the

one hand and the University on the other, isof concernLiTh'is

     

insurance next year and that covered services under the
current plan will remain essentially unchanged. L 
I Consider the following illustration: Assume the total premium

for a, family in the HMO plan rises 25 percent, from $480 .

to $600 per month,.and the University decides to share the
increase in premium equally with the participating employee.
The employee would face an increase in out—of-pocket cost of
$60 per month. Currently the University pays 77 percent of the
premium for the family with the HMO plan. Equal sharing of
the premium increase would mean _that the percentage of the
premium paid by the University would decrease to 72 percent
and the percentage paid by the employee would rise.

For a low wage employee, a $60 _per month. increase is a
substantial one. The increasesin employee shares for individuals,
parent/child, husband/wife” and family in the “Point—of—Service
plan would be even greater if the University shared the premium
increase equally with the participants.

My prime concern is that some current health insurance‘ plan
‘participants, other than those with individual coverage, because
of premium increases,‘might' elect not to continue coverage‘ for

spouses and/ or children, and choose only individual ‘coverage, in‘

order ‘to have money available for other family needs. I believe
most readers would agree that for some family members to

be without health insurance coverage is a very risky course.’

Paradoxically, for every Pitt employee who would make such

. a change, the Universitywould save close to $200 per month

based on current premium allocations, becausethe University
contributes approximately twice as much to the total insurance
premium for a unit’ (parent/child, husband/wife and family)
as it does for an individual. .
University administrators frequently have said that salary and
fringe beneﬁts are elements of total employee compensation,
and the allocation of increases in total compensation each year
should take both salary and fringe beneﬁts into consideration.
Thus, if a fringe beneﬁt, e.g. University ‘contribution to health
insurance premiums ‘for employees, were to increase substantially

because of a large increase inpremiums, the amount available for‘ "

salary increases would have to be diminished.

The challenge for 2003-2004 is to provide opportunities for
faculty and staff to express theirviews to University administration
on: the allocation of anyincrease in the compensation pool
between University health insurance premium contributions
and salary increases. Important and complex economic,‘social,
institutional and moral fairness issues are present in this context.
Salary increases are subject to federal, state and local income
taxes, and Social Security taxes, which can amount to from 15
percent” to 35 percent, or even more, of any salary increase,

. depending on a particular employee’s salary. Increases in

sentiment on the subject.

University contributions to health insurance premiums do
not increaseemployee tax obligations. Note also that health
insurance premium increases are the same for all employees
who elect the same plan and coverage, regardless of the size of
each employee’s salary. Salary increases, on the other hand, are
usually granted on a percentage‘ of salary basis; thus a 3 percent
increase for a faculty member with a $100,000 salary is 300
percent greater than a_3 percent increase for an employee with a
$25,000 salary. A lower paid employee ordinarily beneﬁts more
from an increase in a- fringe beneﬁt, paid on ;a ﬁxed amount
basis for all, such as the University’s shareof health insurance
premiums, than a percentage increase in salary, as long as he/ she
can afford his/her share of the beneﬁts cost, if any. .
Those who have views on how to allocate the increase in the
compensation pool for 2003-2004,'assuming there will be an
increase, between salary and health insurance premiums, should
inform their representatives in the Faculty Assembly and’Senate
Council, members of the beneﬁts and welfare and the budget
policies committees of the University Senate, and the Staff
Association Council leadership. While the administration is not
bound by advice any of the above might offer, I have little doubt
that the administration would be interested in faculty and staff

Gay adoption court ruling = tuition
beneﬁts, for employees’ dependents

hanks to the state

Supreme Court, some

' gay and lesbian Pitt

employees now have an addi-

tional fringe beneﬁt: Tuition

remission for their dependent
children. ' _

The court ruled last week that
gays and lesbians in Pennsylvania
may adopt the children of their
partners. If such a child is a
dependent of a qualiﬁed Pitt
employee and gains admittance
to -the University, he or she will
qualify for Pitt tuition beneﬁts.

Robert Hill, Pitt vice chancel-
lor for Public Affairs, said: “It
doesn’t matter who your partner
is — ifyou’re a Pitt employee and
you adopt a child‘ who becomes

' your legal dependent, that child

would be eligible” for beneﬁts
that the ' University offers to
dependent children of its faculty
and staff. . C
Pitt ofﬁcials said they don’t
know how many students might
end up attending the University

' . as dependents of gay and lesbian

employees. “I don’t know thatwe
would have any way of ﬁnding out
that number, ”_ said Nancy Gilkes,
Pitt manager of Compensation
and Beneﬁts.

At last count,‘ some 20
employees had A registered with

Pitt to receive beneﬁts already
offered here to same—sex domes-
tic partners, including tuition
beneﬁts and library privileges.
“But there’s no way of telling how
many children those and other

. gay and lesbian [Pitt] employees

have,” said Pittsburgh attorney
Christine Biancheria, who led

the legal effort to permit adop-

tions by same-sex partners in
Pennsylvania. (Biancheria also
was among the ACLU lawyers
who represented plaintiffs in the
lawsuit— currently suspended —
by current and former University
employees seeking Pitt medical
beneﬁts for same-sex partners
here.) _ - ,
Dependent children of regu-
lar full-time staff and full-time

faculty, faculty librarians, ROTC .

faculty and research associates
are eligible for scholarships
covering full undergraduate
tuition at Pitt for a’ maximum of
12 terms of study toward a_ ﬁrst
baccalaureate degree.

“If that child is on your
income tax Form 1040 as a
dependent, then they would be
eligible” for tuition remission,
said Gilkes.

Proportionate tuition schol-
arships are offered to children
of tenured part-time facultyand

part-time, tenure stream faculty,
as well as some part-time faculty
librarians.

In addition, dependent chil-
dren of full-time faculty and
regular full-time staffwith at least
one year of University service
may apply to participate in the
Tuition Exchange Scholarship
Program..The program involves
some 350 U.S. colleges and uni-
versities whose employees may
send their dependent children
to any other Tuition Exchange
school at signiﬁcant cost reduc-
tion or no tuition charge. Nearly
40 Pennsylvania‘ institutions
participate in the program,

efore moving to Pitts-
burgh from Portland,
Ore.,’ this summer, Amy
Evans could hardly have been

described as a ﬁre-breathing.

promoter of dragon boating,
a 2,000-year—old sport that
originated in China.

She had paddled in Portland .

for just one season — four years
ago — on the 40.-foot—long,
canoe—like boats, which feature
ﬁerce-looking dragon heads on

- their bows and scaly tails on their

sterns. Inside each boat, 18-22

people sit two abreast, paddling
in sync (ideally) as a tiller at
the back of the boat steers and
a drummer in the front beats

the paddling rhythm — the

“heartbeat of the.dragon.”

But then Evans heard that
two Hong Kong—style dragon
boats would be winging their way
to Pittsburgh, courtesy of the city
Urban Redevelopment Author-
ity and the Greater Pittsburgh
Sister City Association, as part
of the 20th anniversary of the
relationship between Pittsburgh

and Wuhan, China.

Evans, the new academic
adviser. for the undergraduate
program in 'Pitt’s School of
Health and Rehabilitation ‘Sci-
ences, thought: What a great way
to meet people, get a cardiovas-
cular workout and lure tradition-
ally river-shy Pittsburghers out
to play on the water.

Evans also saw an oppornmity
for Pitt staff, faculty and students
to get in at the hatchling stage
of dragon boating as a local
sport. “At ‘some universities and
corporations it even promotes
fun-loving interdepartmental
competition. Certainly, great
topics of water—cooler conversa-
tion,” she wrote in an e-mail
aimed at recruiting Pitt dragon
boaters. .

Evans began paddling with
the Steel City Rowing Club,
one of two homes for the city’s
dragon boats. (Steel City’s black-
and-gold boat is kept at the
Sylvan Canoe Club in Verona,‘
Pa. The other boat, painted red-
and-gold, is housed at the Three
Rivers Rowing Association on
Washington’s Landing, North
Shore.) .

VVhat Evans did not envision
was gettingdrafted as a coach
of the Steel City club’s dragon

- boaters.

CI
“The stroke is in your back,
not your arms,” Evans explained
to novices and reminded experi-
enced paddlers, during a practice
last week on the Allegheny
River. , _ _
Evans, stood up in the boat
as she shouted instructions.
The craft swayed only slightly.
Dragon boats are very stable and
will ﬂoat even when swamped.
(A new boat costs about $10,000,
so they’d better not sink.) For
added safety, paddlers must wear
life jackets or at least take them

4..

along in the boat.

“Now, reach your paddle as
far forward as you can toward the
knees of the person in front of
you, turning your body inward
toward the middle of the boat,”
Evans urged. “Plunge your

' paddle into the water and turn
your body so that your paddle is
drawn back to your knee. That’s
where you should lift the paddle
out of the water.

“Then map your paddle for-
ward again because you want that
forward motion to be very fast.
Then plunge the paddle down
again into the water.”

Plunge. Back. Up. Snap.

Plunge. Back. Up. Snap.

“That’s your basic stroke,”
said Evans, who by default
became a de facto coach for the
Steel City Rowing Club because
few other members had -any
experience with dragon boats.
Witness the veteran Steel City
rower who volunteered to handle
the tiller -— a 20-foot—long oar
— during a recent practice and
proceeded to steer the dragon
boat in circles. When a barge
loomed over the. horizon and

....l>.e.gaa...g1292sin2..towarcls the

' agoh‘ boat, another -pa ler
took over the tiller.

In an e—mail to club members
later that evening, the ﬁrst tiller
assumed a mock-defensive tone:
“I don’t believe that we were

nearly so close to the barge
as people claimed and I also
happen to think that paddling in
a circle promotes balance and
is a valuable skill,” she wrote.
“For those of you who seek out
the securityand boredom of
paddling‘ in a straight line, I
will not be steering tomorrow
night.” I

“In dragon boating, you have
about 20 people on ﬁxed seats,
paddling with ashort, quick
stroke that should be completely
in front of the paddler,” noted
Alek Gralewski, head coach of
the University of Pittsburgh
Rowing,Club. “A dragon boat

paddle is basically a canoe paddle. , A

That’s in contrast to a rowing
shell, where you have "four or
eight people on sliding seats,
taking long strokes with 12-foot
oars.”

One of the charms of dragon -

boat racing is that success
depends more on teamwork than
brute" strength, Evans pointed
out. That was demonstrated on
July 14, when dragon boats raced
locally for the first time during

During, those races, a 
paddled by men ﬁnished ahead
of a women’s team by ‘a mere’
4 seconds, and the women’s
team beat an “open” boat, i.e.,
one with both male and female

per minute, although 60-75 Is a strong pace.

' V’ 

paddlers.

“The women went a lot faster
than the open boat, which was
telling,” Evans recalled. “I think
that was because we had confus-
ing. leadership in the open boat,
where different people were
trying to dictate how fast the
paddling went and it got out
of sync.” ' A 0

A well-synchronized, fast-
paddling men’s team usually will
beat an equally efﬁcient women’s
team simply because men tend to
be stronger, said Evans. Except
in elite racing, the paddlers’
weight isn’t much of a factor
because the ﬁberglass-hulled
dragon boats themselves are so
heavy.

“But it’s still true that dragon
boating is a sport at which women
can be competitive, which adds
to the fun,” Evans said.

That  together with the
opportunity to get out on Pitts-
burgh’s rivers —- attracted Kit
Ayars,‘ senior assistant’ to Pitt
Provostjames Maher, to dragon

boating. “Mainly, I’m doing it _

for the pleasure of being out on
the water, but you do work up a
sweat,”- said Ayars, who paddles
with the Three Rivers_ Rowing

‘Association. ” L . .
“Its always seemed a shame to
me that so few Pittsburghers use
the city’s rivers for recreation.
Until this summer, I hadn’t seen
anyway to do so myself. Butwhen
I heard about dragon boating,
-it seemed like something that I

could work into my schedule.”

experience rowing? Canoeing? ’

” ‘Kathleen Shade, another Pitt
staff memberwho practices with

the Three Rivers club, said,
“When I heard that some people
from the Universitywere getting
into dragon boating, I thought:
VVhat a fun thing to do. It’s
outside, it’s great exercise, it’s on
the water and it’s a great group
activity.”

' Like their counterparts at
the Steel City club, beginning
paddlers. at Three Rivers have

been welcomed enthusiastically, -'

said Shade, who is director
of organizational development
in Pitt’s Office of ' Human
Resources. . A a
“My experience has been that
even the-club’s very seasoned
people are really supportive of
new people, really friendly and

willing to teach you how to

paddle,” she said. ‘ ,

So far, recruiting for dragon
boaters, at Pitt has been “very
slow,” Evans allowed. “I’m only
aware -of several other staff

or two, although there may be
more,” she said.- 2
There’s still time for new
paddlers to get into the sport
and compete in the city’s second
— and main — dragon boating
event this year: a series of races
during the Chinese Autumn
Moon Festival, scheduled for
Sept. -21, 1-1 a.m.-5’p.m., at

at’s the hot issue
on the University
Senate’s agenda
for the new aca-
demic year?

To paraphrase a campaign
mantra from the Clinton years:
It’s the budget, stupid.

“The budget is going to be
a huge issue again this year,”
said Senate President James
Cassing.

“Money is tight, state funding
is down, tuition is way up, and
we’re all going” to have to work

together at this University to _

balance the budget and make it
work,” the economics professor
said. i '
Pitt’s 2002.-'03 ﬁscal ‘year
began last month with news of:
° An unprecedented 3.7 per-
cent reduction in state funding,

‘ coming on top of a 3 percent cut

that the state imposed midway
through FY 2001-02.

0 A not—unrelated 14 percent
tuition increase for Pitt in-state

(undergraduates, the largest

tuition hike here since 1978.

0 Multi-million—dollar losses
in the value of the University’s $1
billion—plus endowment, which
Pitt officials blamed on the
plunging stock market.

° Hefty increases in Pitt’s
utility bills and campus security
budget (the latter largely in
response to the ’  '

in new operating
expenses asso-
ciated with the
Petersen Events

Already, a huge, additional
budgetary challenge looms for
FY 2 003-04: Pitt’s current health
insurance contract with UPMC
Health Plan will expire June
30. “It seems pretty certain that
we’re going to takea big hit

in our health insurance budget if

for next year,” Cassing noted,

.with Pitt’s premiums expected

to increase by about 2 5 percent.
“Senate representatives will be.
working closely with the admin-
istration during this year’s [health
insurance contract] negotiations,
as we have during past negotia-

, tions.” -

Cassing’s predecessor as
Senate president, Nathan-Her-
shey, said he plansto pursue at

A Pittbudget is main concern in
  (year ahead, Senate leaders say

Faculty Assembly a question that
he raises in a column in this issue
of the University Times: Would
Pitt employees, especially lower-

_ paid ones, be better off if the

University paid a larger share of
their health insurance premiums
in lieu of salaryraises? See “Senate

- Matters” column on page 2.

Senate leaders say they also
will pursue what has become a
perennial issue here: Pitt health
beneﬁts for employees’ same-sex
partners.

Last spring, a special Univer-
sity committee (which included
Senate represen_tatives) con-
cluded in a report to Chancel-
lor Mark Nordenberg that Pitt
should extend the beneﬁts even-
tually —— but doing so now
“would not be prudent.”

According to the committee, I
. the most appropriate time for Pitt

to reconsider its policy on same-

sex health beneﬁts would be after

a new governor is inaugurated
and a new legislative session has
begun, and as the University
negotiates a new health insurance
contract. In the meantime, the
committee wrote, Pitt should
work with Pennsylvania,’s other

state-related universities (Penn '

State, Temple and Lincoln)

“and ‘other interested parties”-
toward a common solution that

“would mitigate the risk to the '

University’s good standing with
our elected officials.”
Chancellor Nordenberg has
not indicated when, or how,
he will respond to the report’s
recommendations. -
At a meeting today (Aug. 29),
the Senate’s anti-discriminatory
policies committee is expected
to approve a resolution asking
Nordenberg to give Faculty
Assembly a progress report on
the same-sex beneﬁts issue by
Nov. 26, the Assembly’s last
scheduled meeting of the fall
term.
“Basically, we would like to
know how the administration

' plans to proceed on this issue,”

said anti-discriminatory policies
chairperson Richard Tobias. By
Nov. 26, he noted, Pennsylva-

nians will have elected a new’
. governor and legislature, and

Pitt’s health insurance negotia-
tions will be underway. ’

-Tobias added: “Our resolu-
tion also will ask the administra-
tion to immediately proceed
to consult with the other state-
related universities as recom-
mended by the special commit-
tee.” .

Also this year, the Senate’s
beneﬁts and welfare committee
will continue to push for faculty
access to recreation facilitiesat
the new Petersen Events Center.
Currently, those facilities are

limited to students.

And Senate representatives
will continue to serve on a pair of
provost-convened committees:
one that is studying possible
threats to academic freedom
posed by outside funding agen-
cies, and another that is review-
ing the effectiveness of Pitt’s

10-year-old University Planning
and Budgeting System.
“Another thing the Senate
will be doing this year is monitor-
ing closely the University’s new
system for faculty evaluations
of department chairpersons,”
Cassing said. '

But the Senate president said
his No. 1 priority for this year
will be the same as last year’s:
“For the faculty to be involved
in. University governance, and
to be taken seriously by the
administration and the Board
of Trustees.

“I think we’re getting there,”
Cassing said. He singled out
for praise trustees chairperson
VV1lliam S. Dietrich H, who, like
Cassing, was re—elected in July
to a second consecutive one—year
term. “Bill Dietrich has shown
nothing-but the best possible
attitude toward the faculty and its
role in University governance.

“The faculty doesn’t usually
speak well of the Board of
Trustees,” Cassing added, with
a laugh, “but I have nothing
but goodﬁthings to say about
Dietrich so far.”

men — one of the most aca-
demically accomplished and
diverse classes in the Universi-
ty's history. ‘
Forty-one percent ranked in
the top 10 percent of their
high school graduating
classes, and‘735 were eligible
for admission to the Univer-

School of Education Dean
Alan Lesgold provided informa-
tionion the school’s three new
faculty members.

“David Post joins us from
Penn State, where he was associ-
ate professor of education and
human and family development
studies,” Lesgold said. “He has

a Ph.D. from the University of .

Chicago.”

Post is an associate professor
in the Department of Admin-
istrative and Policy Studies. His
areas of research include educa-
tional expansion in Hong Kong,
education and child develop-
ment in Latin America, politi-
cal foundations of U.S. educa-
tion policy and other issues of
educational policy research.

Two new assistant professors
have joined the Department of
Instruction and Learning.

Jennifer Cartier has a Ph.D.
in education and a master’s in
biochemistry from the University
of \/V1sconsin—Madison, Lesgold
said. “Her work is in inquiry-
based science learning, and
student understanding of scien-
tiﬁc modeling and scientific
argumentation,” he said. “For
example, she has done work
on children’s understanding of
explanatory models in genet-
ics.” .

Amanda Godley comes to
Pitt after two years of teaching
at California State University,
Sacramento. Her doctorate is
from Berkeley. “She has taught
English, English as a second
language and Latin, and she
also has some special education
experience,” Lesgold said. “Her
work has focused on such topics
as the interplay of gender and
literacy in the classroom, the
teaching of writing, and how vari-
ous discourses about composition
— its economic status, remedial
overtones, conceptions of student
need and labor problems —
emerge in response to changes
in working conditions of writing
instructors.”

new identity. Panther Central
is now the name for the facility

established ayear ago to provide a
central location where members
of the University community
could ‘go to -take care of many
basic service needs. ,
Panther Central currently
encompasses three campus ser-
vices: I.D.s, housing services and
dining services. According to
Joseph Phillips, assistant vice
chancellor for Business, plans
call for placing parts of. some
other units under the center,
such as studentiparking permits.

related issues.

“Benchmarking is part of the
University culture as a whole,”
Mowery said. “We need to start
collecting data on issues that
affect staff.”

Mowery said she was frus-
trated last January while lobby-
ing against an increase in the
computing and network services
fee, which is paid byall students,
including staff registered for
classes. _ e

The Board of Trustees stu-
dent affairs committee, and later
the board, voted to hike the fee
for part—time students from $30
to $65 per term.

“I didn’t have the information
at that time to say how many
staff take advantage of taking
classes, which the trustees com-

mittee considered [to be] a small‘

number,” Lowery said. “Later I
found out that more than 1,000
staff took at least one course
last year.”

Mowery also announced plans
for the SAC—sponsored second

' Shields, president emeritus of -

Rockford College in Illinois and
former president ‘of the College
of Great Falls in Great Falls,
Mont., has been named interim
president of Pitt’s Bradford
campus, ‘effective Sept. 1.

From 1992 until this past
May, Shields served as president
of Rockford College, where he
oversaw a $20 ‘million capital
campaign. He served as president
of the College of Great Falls
from 1977 to 1992. A

“Dr. Shields is highly
esteemed in Rockford for the

' successful, positive and coopera-

tive relationships he built within ’

-the college and between the
college and the community,” said

, Provost James V’ Maher.

Regional campus presidents
report to the provost.

Chancellor Mark A. ,Nor—-

new president continues this

 

year.”

Shields earned a B.A. in
sociology from Carroll College,
graduating magna cum laude
in 1964. He holds two degrees
from Pitt, an M.A. (1966) and a
Ph.D. (1972) in sociology.

During his career in higher
education, Shields has been
involved in community affairs.
Among other positions, he served
as chair of the Greater Rockford
Council of 100, a community

Despite fare hikes, Port Authority decides

not to ask Pitt for more money this year

lthough bus fares in
Allegheny County will
'ncrease this weekend,
Pitt’s fee will remain the same

at least until next August, a Port .

Authority ofﬁcial said.‘ Under a
contractual agreement, Pitt pays
an annual fee in exchange for
free rides throughout the county
on Port Authority buses“ and
light-rail vehicles for Pitt I.D.-
holders. . J __ . 1
Laurie Andrews, PortAuthor-
fity chief operations ofﬁcer, said
that the Pitt contract, which runs
from Aug. 1, 2002, to July 31,

2003, with roll-over provisions. ‘

for succeeding years, will remain
-in effect for the time being.
The Port Authority has sent a
letter to Pitt ofﬁcials, however,
requesting a renegotiation of
fees for the four years beginning
.Aug.' 1, 2003. 5 - 1
Instead of asking the Univer-
sity for a 25 percent increase
in this year’s payment — the
amount fares will go up this Sept.
1 on other pre-paid fares such
as weekly and monthly passes
—— the transit company decided
to take a longer-range view,
Andrews said.
In a letter sent to Pitt ofﬁcials
Aug. 5, she said, the Port Author-
. ity laid out a proposal for increa_s—
, ing Pitt’s fee incrementally over
the four years beginning Aug.
1, 2003, to put the payment

structureimore in line with

the Port Authority’s other fare

income streams. " I
Andrews said that Port

«Authority dataindicate that the

transit company, taking into
account all sources of fare income
including cash, discounted passes
and other pre-paid fares, cur-
rently receives on average $1.12
for each ride._ In contrast, Pitt’s

payInent,,aver_age'd out over Pitt,

ridership, comes to about 46
cents per ride, she said.

Port Authority ﬁgures indi-
cate that ridership for Pitt
customers accounts for some
450,000 rides per month on
average. _ —

“Duringourlastnegotiations,
Pitt agreed to‘ pay $2.52 million
per year, which was an increase
over the previous year” when the
University paid $2.28 million,
Andrews said. The $2 .52 million
was the annual fee agreed to
through July 31, 2006, absent
renegotiation. , V

“What our letter said was
that wewould like to renegotiate
Pitt’s fee with the goal to reach
at least 80 percent of the average

' fare we get per ride,” counting all

sources of fare income, Andrews
said. She said the letter asked Pitt
to agree to the goal in principle
rather {than presenting a fee
schedule, which can be worked
out before next August.

“Our goal is to raise [Pitts]
ﬁgure to about 90 cents [per
ride], which would be over 80
percent of our total fare—per—ride
structure of $1.12,” Andrews
said. “So that, beginning in
August 2003, over the next four
years, we’d like to see,Pitt’s fee
go" up about 45-50 cents per ride.
We’ve made the same request
of CMU.” ' , .

Andrews said that the four-
year timeframe proposed by the
Port Authority coincides with
the transit company’s expectation
that by 2 007 all vehicles would be
equipped with special fare boxes
that would weed ‘out expired
or otherwise invalid I.D.s and
eliminate human error by driv-
ers who currently calculate
Pitt‘ ridership by viewing I.D.

’ cards and pushing a designated

counter. ~
“For us, such a data-collecting

A system is a long-terms capital

investment. But we expect it to
be in all our vehicles by 2007,”
Andrews said. 5

Institute gets
$8.9 million for
research into
osteoarthritis

The University of Pittsburgh
Arthritis Institute has received
an $8.9 million grant from the
National Institutes of Health’s
(NIH) National Institute of
Arthritis and Musculoskeletal
and Skin Diseases for a research
study on early osteoarthritis
(OA) in the knee, with the
ultimate goal of speeding OA
drug development.

Pittsburgh is one of four,

clinical centers nationally to
participate in the Osteoarthritis
Initiative, a public—private part-
nership that brings together new
resources to help ﬁnd biologi-
cal and structural markers for
progression of this degenera-
tive joint disease, Which is a
major cause of disability in older
people.

The seven-year project,
which will recruit 5,000 people
nationallyathighriskofdevelop—
ing osteoarthritis in. the knee, will
collect information and deﬁne
disease standards. 0 ‘

. C. Kent Kwoh, professor
of medicine and epidemiology,

is the principal investigator for ‘

Pitt. .
“The ultimate goal of the

5 Osteoarthritis Initiative is to
identify biomarkers of disease

risk and! or progression,” Kwoh
said. “These biomarkers are

. critical to the development

of new therapies to halt the
progression of osteoarthritis,
Our current treatments address

only symptoms such» as pain .

without changing the course of
the disease.” ’ V
Kwoh said that next spring

. the Arthritis Institute will begin

recruiting between 1,250 and
1,500 participants over age 50
who will undergo periodic X-ray
and magnetic resonance imag-
ing examinations to reveal any
physical changes in the knee
joint along with blood draws to
identify biomarkers. This infor-
mation will go into a national
database. ‘

_ While recent advances have
yielded highly effective therapies
for rheumatoid arthritis, no such

therapies exist for osteoarthritis, _

and most current treatments are
designed only to relieve the pain
and stall the disability caused by
bone and joint degeneration.

Today, 35 million people —
1 3 percent of the U.S. population
—— are 65 or older and more
than half of them show evidence
of osteoarthritis in at least one
joint. ‘By 2030, 20 percent of
Americans —— about 70 million
people .—— will have passed their
65th birthday and will be at
increased risk for OA.

The Osteoarthritis Initiative’s
co-principal investigator at Pitt
is Anne Newman, associate
professor of geriatric medicine.
Co-investigators include Bret
Goodpastor, assistant professor
of medicine and endrocrinol—
ogy; Douglas Robertson _Ir.,

‘effectively improve disability

of the wrist and ﬁngers after a
stroke, according to an article
in The New England Journal
of Medicine. A

A The study assessed the effects
of singular BTX-A injection
sessions on measures of self—care,
limb posture, pain and muscle
tone. Sixty—two percent of the
patients receiving the BTX-A
injections reported improvement
in their symptoms, with no seri-
ous adverse effects. The beneﬁts

, lasted for at least 12 weeks.

“Seventy percent of patients
survive stroke or, in other words,
six out of 1,000 people in the
United States are stroke sur-
vivors,” said Ross Zafonte,
professor and chair of the Pitt
medical school’s Department
of Physical Medicine and Reha-
bilitation,‘ who participated in
the trial during his tenure at
the Rehabilitation Institute
of Michigan. “Many of these
patients experience spasticity of
the upper limbs, which limits
their ability to participate in
many activities of day-to-day life
like dressing and washing. This
study proves that botox injections
can dramatically improve these

' patients’ quality of life.”

Spasticity — tight or stiff
muscles that may be subject to
spasms — can affect the arms
and/or legs with stiffness, pain,
long-term ‘muscle shortening,
ﬁbrosis and loss of muscle tone.
Spasticity is caused by. injury to

. the brain, as in str0ke,,'"causing.

the brain to lose control’ of
muscle function. V

“This study conﬁrms , the
efficacy of a treatment that
doctors across the country. have
been offering to their patients at
centers like the UPMC Spasticity
Center for some time now,” said
Nlichael C. Munin, director of
the UPMC SpasticityTreatrnent
and Evaluation Center. “Most
importantly, the study proves not
only that the treatment works by
reducing muscle tone, but it also

shows the positive rehabilitative A

effects — and that is what matters
most to outpatients.” 0 F

People with I‘ type 1 diabetes '

—— are less likely to develop ~ "

{diabetes-related complications,

according to a_ study by Pitt ‘

researchers. .
Using data from 429 subjects

in the Pittsburgh Epidemiology I

of Diabetes Complications Study,
researchers found people who
were treated primarily by general
practitioners developed a higher
incidence of coronary artery

disease, kidney disease and
problems with their nerves.
Those who spent two-thirds of
their years of diabetes under the
care of a specialist — such as an
endocrinologist, diabetologist or
doctor at a diabetes clinic —were
one-third to one-half as likely to

develop these complications.
The researchers concluded
that specialist care, or coordi-
nated care between generalist
and specialist providers, should
be made more broadly available
to all people with type 1 diabetes.

, The current lack of access to
- specialist care by some popula-

tions may be due to lack of cover-
age by some health insurance

plans and a lack of patient knowl-
edge about available resources.

Ground broken for Bradford campus building

Construction crews broke
ground last month on Blaisdell
Hall, the $13.5 million com-
munications and ﬁne arts build-
ing at the Bradford campus.

In the ﬁrst phase of the
project, expected to be completed
by fall 2003, workers will build
the 18,485 sq.—foot brick building
in the area that had served as
the campus’s soccer ﬁeld. The
Blaisdell Fine Arts Challenge
raised $3 .4 million toward the
ﬁrst phase.

The second phase, which is
expected to begin in the fall,
will include a 500—seat theatre
with a large reception space, a
black box theatre, an art gallery,

a scene shop and ofﬁces. The
second phase of the project,
which will total 25,900 sq. feet
and will cost $8.5 million, is
being funded by stateimoney.
Jeff Guterman, associate
professor of communications
and chair of the communication
arts department, said the new
facility “will provide a wonderful
advancement into the digital side
of media. Our students will have
ready access to sophisticated
workstations for sound and

.moving image experimentation.

Through a combination of con-
vergence and creative emphasis,
communications and public
relations students will work side-

by—side in facilities that are in

close proximity to the art, music-

and theatre areas.”

Work also has begun on the
Frame-Westerberg Commons
building, the student center at
Bradford, which is undergoing
a $9.5 million expansion and
renovation.

In the Commons project, the
majority of which is expected
to be ﬁnished by the fall 2003,
the ﬁrst ﬂoor will be completely
renovated and 9,482 square feet
will be added. A second main
entrance also will be built at the
rear of the building, and minor
renovations will be made to the

create the scholarship to memo-
rialize her mother because,
“my mother has always been a
supporter of nursing.” _

She also said she created the
scholarship because “I am a nurse.
I got my ﬁrst degree through
the support of my mother and
father. After that, I received
my education with the help
of scholarships, government

stipends and hospital tuition
reimbursement programs. I have
always planned on trying to help
somebodyjelse get a scholarship
in nursing.”

. The donations all will be
matched by the Reed-Coit Schol-
arship Challenge, which matches
any gift totaling at least $5,000
that is designated for a new
scholarship. -

The challenge was made possi-
ble bya $1 million bequest byDor-
othy Reed. I

Pharmacy gets substance abuse grant

. The School of Pharmacy

T has received a three—year‘grant

totaling $400,000 from the
Pennsylvania Department- of
Health’s Bureau of. Drug and

.Alcohol programs to, address

alcohol‘ and substance abuse by
young people between the ages
of 12 and 25 and the community
at large. ' V .

In 2000, the Pennsylvania
D epartment of Health estimated
that the number of Pennsylva-

' nians in need of treatment was
_more than 630,000 while the '
number who received treatment

was about 69,000. _

, Funds for the substance abuse
grant were provided by the
Substance Abuse Mental Health

Services Administration Center

for Substance Abuse Preven-
tion.
“Our goal is to build a

L comprehensive resource center

related to addictions research,
health policy, prevention, inter-
vention and treatment, and to

develop effective mechanisms

to transfer that knowledge to. the
substance abuse ﬁeld and policy
makers,” said Jan Pringle, _ assis-
tant professor of pharmaceuti-

cal sciences at thepharmacy

school. .
Pringle also is scientiﬁc direc-
tor of the Pittsburgh—based

, Institute for Research Education

and Training and Addiction, a
statewide initiative dedicated to
aligning research and practice
through education and policy
development.

Information from the grant
will be‘ collected and catalogued
by the Performance Based Pre-
vention System database in
orderto manage substance abuse
prevention activities, monitor
performance and ‘outcomes and
evaluate performance effective-
ness. The database also will be
centrally hosted, providing real
time data accessand operation.

Pitt’s School of Pharmacy’

will be collaborating with more
than a dozen state, federal and

- community agencies. I
