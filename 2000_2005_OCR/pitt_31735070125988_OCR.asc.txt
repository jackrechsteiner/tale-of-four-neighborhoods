Pitt to eliminate

campus vendors

KATE GIAMMARISE ‘
Staff Writer

For 16 years, Dan Fallon sold posters in
front of the \_lV1lliam Pitt Union. As of Nov.
1, he and other Vendors will no longer be

"allowed to sell wares or services there.

According to Joe Cavalla, Pitt’s direc-
tor of student activities, the University’s
change in policy is in response to new city
ordinances that went into effect some time
in the last six months.

Cavalla said that vending in front of the
Union will be “put on hold,” but that the
Student Organization Resource Center is
exploring the possibility of continuing to
allow vendors on the lower level of the
Union.

Though Cavalla couldn’t speciﬁcally
name the new law, he said it affects certain
aspects of vendor licensing, such as who
can be a vendor and where. they are permit-
ted to sell. Until this point, vendors such as
Fallon had to sign a contract through
SORC, agreeing to pay $50 per day to sell
their products on campus. Vendors selling
credit cards and similar intangible services

wouldn’t be permitted to sell his posters
after Oct. 31. He suspects, though, that a
few overly pushy vendors were the reason.
As someone who was born and raised
in Pittsburgh, Fallon said it has “always
been wonderful to have a reason to come
back.” He said he remains hopeful that the
situation will be resolved, saying that he
“would love to be able to come back to Pitt
... the school has been good to us.”
Other vendors expressed similar senti-
ments. '

Dolly Franzos, who has sold jewelry ‘

outside the Union since 1987, said she was
devastated. -Bob Waskowicz, who sells
books there, added that “the students have
been really supportive, and so has SORC.”

Charles Bonasorte, who runs the
Pittsburgh Stop on the comer of Forbes
Avenue and Bigelow Boulevard, said
University decisions wouldn’t affect his
business because he operates. on public
property. .

But Bonasorte expressed sadness at the

impending loss of his fellow vendors, 1

describing them as “credible” and “good for
all of us.”

According to Anthony Mignogna and Michael’ Russo,
cleanliness in Towers bathrooms isn’t much of a priority.

The pair said that when they complained that their bath-

room hadn’t been cleaned for almost six days, they were told
"a housing services supervisor that it “didn’t look that b .”

. The students, who live in Tower C, claim that the depart-
ment of housing services repeatedly ignored their requests to
have their bathroom cleaned — a service that housing is sup-
posed to provide to students every weekday.

According to Mignogna, the second‘ﬂoor bathroom A
i only had one clean toilet and two functioning showers for the

30 students who live there.
The men also say brown water was coming out of the

4 sinks and the urinals leaked onto the ﬂoor. They said that

when they called housing to complain, they were told they
should have notiﬁed housing earlier.

“We pay good money to live here,” Mignogna said. “It’s
not my responsibility to make sure the bathrooms are clean.”

Others have similar complaints. According to resident
assistants in the building, over the last few weeks residents
have complained about a lack of toilet paper, lack of soap,
ﬂooded showers and even a report of ringworm contracted
from a shower stall. .

Selena Brown, a 10th ‘ﬂoor RA in Tower C, said her

’ bathroom almost always has garbage lying on the ﬂoor and

the stalls constantly nm out of toiletpaper. Once, Brown said,
a girl‘ threw up in the bathroom on a Friday and, despite
Brown’s calls to housing, the mess remained through the
weekend." . I '
According to Rochelle Edwards, lead supervisor of
housing services, the bathrooms are supposed to be chemi-
cally cleaned every weekday. The machine used by cleaners
sprays a chemical germicide and disinfectant on all surfaces
of the bathroom, dislodging dirt and residue, and the excess
water is vacuumed up. Because this process soaks the entire

T owerC residents say bathrooms dirty,neglected

bathroom, the rooms are closed off to residents when being
cleaned V

Michele Scott Taylor, resident director of Tower C, said
she’s ﬁelded many complaints over the last few weeks.
Students have complained that housekeeping doesn’t show
up to clean the bathroom at its designated time, preventing
students from using the bathroom when they need to.

Taylor explained that many times the housekeeping staif
is delayed in other bathrooms, preventing them from being
on time —— or staff members call off sick and replacements
must be found before cleaning can begin.

“People call oif. Not that that’s acceptable, but it hap-
pens,” Taylor said.

Edwards added thatbecause housing has a reduced 0

labor force on weekends and holidays, workers don’t tend to
bathrooms right away and they come in at different times to
reﬁll toilet paper or clean out garbage. _

COURTESY PITTSBURGH SUPERCOMPUTING CENTER

This computer, housed in a Monroeville, Pa., facility, is now the world’s most
powerful computer dedicated to non-classified research. ‘ —

Fastest non—govemmentalmacI1ine to
predict weather, modelearthquakes

MIKE MASLANIK
The Pitt News

On Oct. 1 it came‘ to life.

That was the day the Pittsburgh
Supercomputing Center, in collabora-
tion with Compaq Computer Corp.,
activated the world’s most powerful
computer dedicated to non-classiﬁed
research. _ _

The computer, known as the
Terascale Computing System, was built
in a joint effort by Pitt, Carnegie Mellon
University and the Westinghouse
Electric Co. The National Science
Foundation provided the center with
$36 million in funding to purchase the
system. The foundation provided an
additional $9 millionto pay for the com-
puter’s operation.

“Our goal is to provide a facility for
computational scientists to tackle the
largest and most complex problems,”
said’Robert Stock, associate director of
computer center. _ _ V

Most notable in the Terascale is the
processing ‘power of six trillion opera-
tions per second. That speed is made
possible by the units 3,000 data proces-
sors — the equivalent of 3,000 top-of-
the-line personal computers.

The system features three terabytes
of memory, about 10,000 times the stor-
age capacity of an average computer.

The supercomputer is housed in
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center’s
building in Monroeville. It occupies a
space about the size of a basketball
court. Fourteen miles of cable are
required to connect the 3,000 proces-
sors, and the system requires 664 kilo-

Processing Power: 6 teraﬂops (6
trillion operations) per second

Memory: 3.0 terabytes

watts of power. That-amount of electric-
ity could power 500 homes.

The staff at the Monroeville site
consists of 72 employees from
Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center,
along, with a rotating group of advisers
from Westinghouse and Compaq.

The computer will be used for a
multitude of purposes, including model-
ing chemical reactions in the human
body. This information will be applied
to the research and development of new
drug therapies. *

The system will also be able to map
and predict meteorological behavior,
pinpointing potential tornadoes before
they ‘can’ cause damage. Other uses
include earthquake modeling, astro-
nomical research and 'rnechaI1ical design
programs. The extremely fast process-
ing time allows for greater details in the
results of these experiments. '

Pitt honors 53 black  

freshman scholars

CHRISTIAN SCHOENING
The Pitt News

A reception held yesterday afternoon
honored 53 black freshmen who are recipi-
ents of four-year scholarships through the
University Challenge for Excellence
Program. " .

The scholarships are awarded by differ-
ent schools within the University, including
the School of Nursing, the School of

Engineering and the College of Arts and -

Sciences.

Felicia Pope, an adviser for UCEP and
CAS, said that the honored students possess
“a drive for excellence and abilities that
complement their drive.”

The Chancellor’s Scholarship is the
highest honor Pitt offers to incoming fresh-
men. This year Kharec Staten received the
award. Staten, who is from Philadelphia,
plans to major in the English writing depart-
ment’s poetry track and is also considering
studying philosophy.

“[It] feels like the scholarship means
that the Univcrsityhas put its trust in Inc,”
Staten said. - A

The Davis Scholarship, which was pre-
sented this year for the ﬁrst time, is named
for 1947 graduatcAdena Davis and was pre-
sented to two students. Davis was the ﬁrst
black woman to graduate from the School of
Nursing.

According to Davis’, the two students
honored with the scholarship express a com-
mitment to the health community and poten-

tial to be very successful in the nursing ﬁeld.

The Henderson Scholarship of the
School of Engineering honors outstanding
performance in high school. It was given to
four students this year.

According to Denise Walden and Angie I

Daniel, UCEP representatives from the
School of Engineering, this year’s recipients
are well—rounded.

Daniel said that they possess an “I—

know—I—can—do—it mindset.”

According to Black Action Society
adviser J ackic Crawford, the Lavclle
Scholarship from BAS is given to students
who demonstrate “leadership potential and
organizational excellence.” .‘

Erica Deskins, this year’s Lavclle
Scholar, is from Virginia. She plans to major
in marketing, ﬁnance and perhaps commu-
nication. Desldns said she was “ecstatic”
when she received the award..Happy with
her decision to come to Pitt, Deskins said the
scholarship was “the icing on the cake.”

The 34 Honors Challenge Scholars
were chosen based on academic excellence
that set them apart from other high school
students.

Robert Powell, who received the
Honors Challenge scholarship, said he
“irnrnediately accepted and was very enthu-
siastic’? when he was offered the award.

“These are very bright, academic stu-
dents,” said Betsy Portcr, director of admis-
sions and ﬁnancial aid. “They possess quali-
ties that set them apart ﬁom their fellow high
school students.”

Carnegie Mellon, Duquesne

say vendors will stay there  

Vendors, page 1

there — people see vendors, and they feel
warm and lovable and ﬁiendly.”

Bonasorte also expressed his puzzle-
mcnt at why the University was asking ven-
dors to leave, saying that the new city laws
only apply to public property, not private
property. «

Other area schools such Carnegie
Mellon University and _ Duquesne
University also have on-carnpus vendors.
According to ofﬁcials from both schools,
that won’t change as a result of city law.

According to Marsha Gerwig, director.
of CMU’s University Center, which over-
sees vendors there, CMU is leavingvall ven-
dor—related decisions up to its governing stu-

dent body.

Gerwig said that in recent months,

some students have complained that ven-
dors -— in particular credit card vendors +
are too pushy. For that reason, the issue will

be taken before CMU’s student senate,

where that body will have ultimate say in
the school’s vendors’ fates. .

“We ‘don’t do it to make money,”
Gerwig said, acknowledging that vendors
on CMU’s campus pay $150 a day to oper-
ate there. “We do it for the students.” ' -

Duquesne spokesman Anne Rago said
that Duquesne does not allow credit card
vendors, but that Duquesne occasionally

permits postcr~typc vendors to operate on -

campus for a day. She said because the new
laws affect public property, they don’t apply
to the university, and will not have an
impact on vending at Duquesne.

Still no links betwee

GAIL GIBSON
The Baltimore Sun

WASHINGTON — Investigators have still found
no links between the Sept. 11 terrorist strikes and the
anthrax attacks that have killed three people in the last
two weeks, FBI Director Robert S. Mueller HI said
Wednesday.

Mueller said it is “not clear” whether the anthrax
cases can be traced to “organized terrorism.”

“But these attacks were clearly meant to terrorize a
country already on the edge,” Mueller said at a meeting
of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. The FBI, he pledged,

I is “responding swiftly to each and every incident.”
Other top U.S. officials, including President Bush, I

have continued to express suspicions that the anthrax
attacks are linked to Osama bin Laden or his al Qaeda
terrorist network. Wednesday, the president, raised that
possibility anew, though he conceded that he has “no
direct evidence.”

FBI agents and postal inspectors intensiﬁed their
focus Wednesday on the Trenton, N .J ., area, where three
anthrax-tainted letters were postmarked. But some
investigators cautioned that the search forthose behind
the threats could be a prolonged one, reminiscent of the
years-long pursuit of the Unabomber or still-unsolved
Tylenol poisonings in the 1980s.

The search for clues has led federal agents to a mail-
sorting facility in New Jersey and to research laborato-
ries across the country. Investigators also are poring
over the three threatening letters that were mailed with
anthrax and that were made public Tuesday, dissecting
the anti-American and anti-Israeli messages and hand-

Writing-
Speaking in Maryland on Wednesday, Bush repeat-
ed suggestions that the anthrax threats could be con-

nected to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World ‘

Trade Center and the Pentagon. .
“Both series of actions are motivated by evil and

hate,” the president said. “Botl1 series of actions are i

meant to disrupt Americans’ way of life. Both series of
actions are an attack on our homeland. And both series
of actions will not stand.”

Mueller told the U.S. mayors that the bureau is
pouring its “heart and soul” into the investigations of the
anthrax scares and last month’s terrorist acts. He said
that one in every four FBI employees are directly
involved in what has become the largest criminal inves-
tigation in U.S. history.

At the same time, Mueller said, the bureau is under-
going signiﬁcant intemal changes. Focused" for decades
on solving crimes, the bureau is shifting its focus more
toward trying to prevent crimes, particularly terrorist
acts. '

“Historically, we have been better at tracking down
terrorists after the fact than stopping them in their tracks
before they strike,” Mueller said. To - change that, he
said,_ the FBI must do more to involve local police and
elected officials in counter-terrorism.

Mayor Martin O’Malley of Baltimore, one of the
first local ofﬁcials to publicly question the FBI’s infor-
mation sharing in the weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks,
praised Mueller’s remarks to what was billed as an
-“emergency security summit” of the nation’s mayors.

But in addition, O’Malley said, local police depart-
ments could be doing more to help federal investigators.

Making the Mail Safe

U.S. postal officials are considering a number of technologies
that could be used to sanitize mail to defend against anthrax __
and other airborne bacteria. Regardless of the method chosen,
experts agree that sterilizing the mail would be expensive,
tlmeconsuming and problematic. A look at how an ultraviolet
light system might work: I

‘The problem is getting down to the operational
level,” O’Malley said. “If the FBI has 600,000 tips, the
question is, ‘How many have you been able to follow up
with? And could we help with the other 590,000?’”

Newsday

WASHINGTON —— The House

Wednesday overwhelmingly approved
compromise legislation giving law
enforcement officials broad new powers to
track down and arrest suspected terrorists,
despite misgivings by both opponents and
supporters that the bill may lead to wide-
spread detention and harassment of immi-
grants.
. The bill passed on a 357-66 vote, after
Senate and House leaders moved to ease
fears of opponents that the legislation
would broadly impinge on civil liberties.
Among other provisions, leaders decided
to put a four—year time limit on the new
powers, so if they are abused, the legisla-
tion could be reconsidered, rejecting pleas
from Attorney General John Ashcroft to
make the powers permanent.

The bill now moves to the Senate,
where it has hit a snag over a provision
pressed by Sens. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., and
Gordon Smith, R-Ore. The senators tried to
fix a quirk in federal law that prevents U.S.
attorneys from approving undercover oper-
ations in their state. The federal law
requires prosecutors to abide by state ethics
laws, and Oregon has a particularly tough
one that precludes sting operations.

the Senate version of the bill but it was
opposed by the House. The two senators

are using a legislative maneuver to block,

ﬁnal consideration of the bill until they get
their way.
Senate leaders sWednesday wer
searching for a solution. '
Overall, the bill would streamline
wiretapping and surveillance procedures,

, allow surveillance of the Internet and e-
mail, allow sharing of information between

intelligence and law enforcement agencies
and permit immigrants to be detained for
seven days without charges being ﬁled.

Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y.‘, who
voted against the bill, said the detention
provision only calls for‘ a “reasonable
grounds to believe” that an immigrant is
associated with terrorism, which he called
a very weak burden of proof.

“It’s not probable cause here,” he said.
Also, he said, the bill calls for removal pro-
ceedings against the immigrant to begin
within seven days, but does not proscribe
how long those proceedings rrright take.
“The removal proceedings could go on for-
ever,” he said.

“In every war in our history, we have
done things which we were told were nec-
essary for national security, and without
exception we were ashamed of them later,”

Americans during World War II, the
Palmer raids after World War I in which
foreign “radicals” were deported, and the
McCanan Act of the 1950s which required

organizations associated with communism ‘
to register. ’ .

But House Speaker Dennis Hastert
expressed the prevailing view in the House
when he said the bill would “give law
enforcement the.tools necessary to secure
the safety of Americans while protecting
our constitutional rights. This anl:i-terror-
ism bill enhances communication between

law enforcement and surveillance agen-

cies, strengthens control of border abuse by
foreign terrorists, and broadens stiff ' penal-
ties, including life in prison, for terrorist
activities.”

Another part of the bill that sparked _

controversy would make it a crime for non-
citizens to donate to charitable organiza-

Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., said that pro-

EDITORIAL

Vendors should remain at Union

If the vendors on the Fifth Avenue side
of the William Pitt Union leave on Nov. 1,
some students may be elated. Others may
be saddened, ﬁnding their best opportuni-
ties to buy used books, jewelry, posters and
other products gone.

But no matter what their reactions, we
all should be saddened by the way the
University is kicking out the vendors. It’s
forcing the vendors out without citing the
ordinance it says it’s following, without
communicating it properly to the vendors
and without asking the students how we
feel.

Carnegie Mellon University is taking
a different approach to the matter. Its
administration is allowing the Student
Senate to vote on three main choices: all,
some or none of the vendors.

Pitt should do the same. By denying.

students a voice in this matter, the
University is once again ﬂexing its mus-
cles and showing itself insensitive to the
needs of students. We’re the ones affected
by the presence of the vendors, not the
administration. We should have our say.

But not only is the University going
over students’ heads, it’s also doing it in an
underhanded way.

Joe Cavalla, Pittfs director of student
activities, told The Pitt News that the

University ordered the vendors to leave in.

response to a city of Pittsburgh ordinance,
which he could neither name nor date
except for saying the city passed it some-

time in the last six months.

So if the ordinance was passed half a
year ago, why are the vendors still here?

If Cavalla carmot cite the ordinance or
when the city passed it, he should not be
giving it- as a reason for the University’s
action. I

According to the vendors, the
University never even speciﬁed to them
why it was forcing ﬂtem out. A

Although credit card and cellular
phone vendors have gained a reputation
for pushiness, they do provide a valuable
service to students. They are also ordinary
people making a living. .

And their presence does not negative-
ly affect the student body either. Indeed,
any student in an organization has beneﬁt-
ed. Each vendor selling tangible items
pays the Student Organization Resource
Center $50 ‘a day for being there, with ven-
dors selling non-tangible items paying
$100.

SORC provides supplemental assis-
tance to student organizations. Think about

how much it will lose. Assume there are ,

ﬁve vendors per day, three selling tangible
items and two selling intangible services.
'_I‘hat’s $350 per day. Multiply that by ﬁve
days per week and then by, say, 20 weeks
per year. Get the picture? ' A ’

Yes, some vendors ‘in front of the
Union can be pushy. But is the way the
University is kicking tl1em_ out and theloss
worth it? We think not. 8

Pitt’s pathetic response

Last ' Tuesday, Lorraine
Branham, assistant to the publisher
of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,
came to Pitt to speak on cultural
diversity ingthe media. If only she
had come a week earlier.

By the time of Branham’s
speech, The Pitt News had already
been blotched with dishonor and
neglect for failing to capture the
moment of Pitt’s first homecoming
king and queen who both shared a

skin tone darker than the traditional

“white.”

Not only did we miss the oppor-
tunity to capture the moment on
film in a presentable and

We missed that story.
Immature is not Bryant express-

ing his frustration about a football as

team that is not elevating to its true
talent and potential. Immature is
calling the William Pitt Union and

release anthrax.

movie “Carrie,” where fake blood

also missed the inspira-
tional story behind it.

untold number of European Jews. Here,
the “love thy neighbor” tolerance the
Vatican espoused made it nothing more
than a co-conspirator in the murder of
more than six million people.

The United States itself demon-

strated the value of tolerance during the
1980s when the AIDS crisis was first
developing. As HIV ravaged the gay
community, many Americans respond-
ed with an attitude that “those people”
were getting what they deserved. AIDS
was seen as a God"s wrath, a divine
refutation of gay rights, and all too
many people were eager'to believe it.
American tolerance of homosexuals
revealed itself as a shallow facade
behind which hid a cold, hard hatred.
This opinion was not limited just to
Bible thumpers and backwoods red-
necks. This was the opinion of then-
President Ronald Reagan, who with
tremendous shortsightedness viewed
HIV/AIDS as aidisease of gays, drug
addicts,. prostitutes and other people
about whom he just did not care. His
age and infirmity have already. canon-
ized him in the minds of today’s politi-
cal conservatives, some of whomihave
actually proposed carving his face into
Mount Rushmore. His real monument
will be the gravestones of all those who
died because Reagan, with the hateful
prejudices that existed beneath his

grandfatherly veneer, didn’t think an
early response to AIDS affected anyone

that mattered._

Despite all this, tolerance should
not be abandoned as a guideline for
behavior. The ruin in Afghanistan is a
result of a society existing without any
tolerance. Even in our own borders, the

‘recent outbreak of anti-Muslim vio-
lence shows just how uglyan intolerant‘

society can be. V

The decency that united Americans

Oppose fast track

Americans all over the country
have worked together during the last

_ month to repair New York City,

mourn the dead and to try to under-
stand how our foreign policy affects
the state of affairs in the Middle

t East. Congress has also united in -

support of President George W.
Bush’s leadership during this critical
time of crisis. But some members of
Congress have been trying to take
advantage of this situation to pro-
mote controversial legislation.
Although we want our senators and
representatives to work together, it
will be counterproductive and

« _ destructive if they unite behind poli-

cies that will be harmful to human

_ rights, workers’ rights and the envi-

ronrnent.

One example is the fast track
bill sponsored by Rep. Bill Thomas
(R-Calif.). This bill is as potentially
disastrous as the one introduced by
Rep. Phil Crane (R-Ill.) in the spring

- and is being considered by Congress

soon.

A Fast track (now called trade pro-
motion authority) stipulates that
Congress carmot amend trade deals
negotiated by the president. But
hundreds of corporate lobbyists still
have plenty of access to U.S. trade
negotiators through closed-door
trade advisory committees. So fast
track paves the way for many trade
deals that undercut our environmen-
tal, labor, and health and safety laws.

'I‘homas’s new bill does not make "

any‘ labor or environmental provi-
sions mandatory, nor does it require
that internationally recognized stan-
dards be upheld. Unfortunately, Rep.
Melissa Hart (R-Pa.) has not yet
explicitly opposed this bill.

There’ are other examples too,

‘ such as Sen. Frank Murkowski’s (R-

Alaska) and Sen. James Inhofe’s (R-
Okla.) support for the terrible
Energy “Security” bill. We must
unite and help each other, but we
cannot unite behind bad trade policy
or bad energy policy. The greatest
service our representatives and sena-
tors can do for us is to discuss these
critically important issues so that

‘ only -the best bills can pass, in which

labor, the enviromnent and human
rights are priorities, rather than
exploitative corporate interests.

far as to “suppress” information.

But it did neglect to suitably
provide the image and message that
would have been uplifting to not
only “minorities” but alsothe entire
Pittsburgh community.

Had this story been written and
had an adequate picture been pro-
vided (as it was in the Pitt
Campaign Chronicle), people from
within and outside of the University
could look up to Pitt and say, “This
must A be the diversity that
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg talks

about.” Aspiring black, Latino and

Asian high school students contem-
plating attending Pitt would say,
“This must be the type of university
I could attend where I would feel
welcomed.” _

Ofodile was not speaking for
herself when she wrote her letter to
the editor. She was speaking for
hundreds of students of different
races and cultures just as confound-
ed as she was for not seeing a prop-
er picture and proper mention of the
event. ‘

White students hold the home-
coming coronation as pure folly
because for hundreds of years
they’ve grown accustomed to see-

ing people that look like them win
it. We of the minority races and’ cul-
tures have only just begun to expe-
rience what it feels like to see
someone like us win it. So yeah, it’s
a big deal to us.

There was a time when any
mention of a ‘‘colored’’ homecom-
ing king or queen would have been
met with a lynch mob. Judging by
the responses to Ofodile, it doesn’t
feel like we’ve made it that far
since then.

Brentin C. Mock aka J. Rap Brown
would like to urge responses to
remain civil.

Panthers battle to scoreless tie

BEN JOHNSON
Staff Writer

The men’s soccer team played the
Colonials of Robert Morris for 90 minutes
yesterday afternoon in search of not only a
win, but also a complete game. 5

A game in which both the offense and the
defense played to the expectations of head
coach Joe Luxbacher is what yesterday’s
search was for.

After two overtimes, neither team could
figure out the combination to the locks that
guarded the goal. As a result, the game ended
in a 0-0 draw.

Last year’s team found the complete
game and it showed. The Panthers then were
13-5-0 overall and 7-5-0 in the conference.
This year’s soccer team has had its share of
ups and downs.

Pitt entered the game with a record of 4-
7-1 overall and 1-5-1 in the Big East. The
Panthers notched their first conference win
last Saturday against Providence College.

Senior Mike Sikora was the hero of the
game as he scored the game-winning goal
with 7 minutes, 35 seconds remaining in reg-
ulation. ,

Luxbacher stressed playing better defense
and taking. advantage of opportunities going
into yesterday’s game at Robert Morris,

Luxbacher said. “This is a game that I
thought we should have won. I amv disap-
pointed and the team is also disappointed that
we didn’t pull off the win.” .

The matchup proved to be a duel between

the goaltenders, as both ‘played solid the_

entire game. ‘ .

“Robert Morris is a top team in the
Northeast Conference, so we knew that going
into the game that they were going to play us
tough,” Luxbacher stated; «-

Panther goalie Justin Gaul recorded seven
saves, while Colonials goalkeeper Matt
Henson had a season high 11 saves. With the
11 saves, Henson increased his save percent-
age to .788. ' , T

The Panthers had chances early on before
the Colonials took over the momentum in the
second half.

Both‘ teams had scoring opportunities in
overtime but were unable to capitalize. Pitt
had seven shots in overtime while Robert
Morris had two.

Leading the Panthers with six shots on
goal was midfielder Bryan" Hopper.
Defensemen Chris Churchill and Miles
Dowiak both chipped in three ‘shots and
Sikora had two shotson goal. ‘ ’

Pitt will once again try to get both the,
offense and defense to play well together in
hopes of continuing its chaseifor the playoffs.

Following the attacks, the sports world came

resume, some people were not as concerned with
it as they previously had been. ,

So why are people now trying to glorify the

start in their respective divisional series. “The
Big Unit” holds a slight edge over Pettitte in
ERA, 1.88 to 2.18, and outperformed the Yankee
southpaw during the regular season. Johnson
went 21-6 with a 2.49 ERA while Pettitte was
just 15-10 with a 3.99 ERA. ‘

Advantage: Johnson.

But the glaring question seems to be whether
Arizona can be competitive beyond Schilling and
Johnson, especially when the Yanks will follow
with Roger Clemens. The answer is: they can.

In a comparison between the pitching of the
two teams during the regular season, the
Diamondbacks excelled in eight of 10 categories.
Arizona had a lower ERA (3.87 to 4.02), fewer
hits allowed ( 1,352 to 1,429), a greater number

of strikeouts (1,297 to 1,266) and more complete;

games (12 to seven). ,
The only categories that the Yankees came
out on top in were home runs‘ allowed (158 to

195) and saves (57 to 34).

But the Diamondbacks also dominated hit-
ting categories, once again claiming) seven of 10
while the two clubs tied in average at .267.
Arizona sluggers led in home runs (208-203),
hits (1,494 to 1,488) and on-base percentage
(.341 to .334). The Yanks had just slightly fewer
strikeouts (1,035 to 1,052) but prevailed in
stolen bases (161 to 71).

Arizona appears to have an overall advan-
tage, but the play of Luis Gonzalez will be a key
in its success. Gonzalez was the team’s regular
season leader with a .325 average, 57 home runs

and 142 RBIs.

The Diamondbacks will need him to con-
tribute more than the .237 average, two home
runs and five RBIs he has managed so far.

The team has been riding the play of Steve
Finley, who is hitting .364 after a mediocre sea-
son of .275. But the big surprise has been short-
stop Craig Counsell, who is batting .297 with
one home run and seven RBIs after a season of
.275 with four home runs and 38 RBIs in 141
games.

.While the Diamondbacks may have an edge
in the statistics department, the Yanks always
seem to be the team that just won’t die. After los-
ing the first two games of the ALDS, they
bounced back to take the series from the A’s,
spurred by Derek Jeter’s throw to get Jeremy
Giambi at the plate and move the momentum in
favor of New York.

My prediction is Arizona in five, but I
wouldn’t be the least bit surprised if those pesky
Bombers somehow found a way to win.

Damn Yankees.

Gaul lives upto expectations

JEREMY J ESTER
Staff Writer

Justin Gaul is one of the few
bright spots on an otherwise dark and
disappointing season for the Pitt
men’s soccer team.

The 6-foot-5-inch goalkeeper
from Huntingdon Valley, Pa., has
been the team’s starter since his fresh-
man year. He was recently named the
Big East Goalkeeper of the Week after
allowing a single goal against No. 3
St. John’s on Oct.l5. It was the third
time he has received the honor.

He hopes the team (4—7—2 overall,
0-5-1 Big East) can turn the season
around after the upset.

-‘fI’d like to "make a run,” Gaul
said. “I know if we make the Big East
tournament, we’ll make some noise.”

Gaul was chosen as a co‘-captain
along with senior Chris Churchill by
the coaching staff. The junior uses his
play as a way to motivate the team.

’ “I lead by example,” he said. “As
a captain, you should be the leader
and make the big plays, and that’s
what I do.”

Churchill, a defenseman, is thank-
ful Gaul plays behind him.

“As a captain,” Churchill said,

“you have people looking up to you.

And he performs.” _
Gaul was a tremendous high

school athlete, receiving all-state hon-

ors in soccer as well as volleyball.

- ' While he may now be a standout '

-on the soccer team, he is still passion-
ate about the latter. '

“I -really miss playing volleyball,
it is really intense,” Gaul said.

As a freshman, he started all 19
games and compiled a 1.10 goals
against average and placed fifth on
the Panthers’ all-time list with six
shutouts in a season. ’

Last year, Gaul was a cornerstone
on a strong Panther squad that
amassed a 13-5 record. He allowed

more than one goal just six times-

while starting every game, and the
team’s winning percentage was the
best in school history._

Paul Marco, West Virginia’s soc-
cer coach, believes Gaul is one of the
Panthers’ main assets.

“When we play Pittsburgh,”
Marco said, “we look at [Gaul] as
being\one of the team’s strengths.”

Pitt goalkeeper coach _Kirk

Brodows believes Gaul keeps the_

team competitive every game.
“Goalkeepers can’t stop every
shot, but Justin gives the team the
best chance to win,” he said. _
Brodows works with Gaul every
day and is impressed with what he
sees.

“He’s a leader on and off the field i

scoreless tie. He has been named Big East Goalkeeper of the Week three times.

because of his work ethic,” Brodows
said. “He stuck around this ‘summer

and that helped him become a better

keeper.”

Gaul enjoys their relationship.

“We talk about everything,” said
Gaul. “He’s almost like a friend.”

In just his junior year, Gaul ranks
fifth on the Panthers’ all-time list with
239 stops, fourth in career shutouts
(12), third in wins (22) and is tied for
sixth for lowest GAA (1.25).

Allithe accomplishments are not
slowing Gaul down. .

“I’d like to take the game as far as
possible. Hopefully, professionally,”
he said _ _ ,

Pitt head coach Joe Luxbacher
appreciates Gaul’s approach to the

.game.

“He has all the natural ability to
be a great athlete. He has taken a
more mature outlook on training and
still has another level to reach,” he
said.

Luxbacher also likes the "way
Gaul plays. ,-

“He’s

' aggressive,” . said

Luxbacher. “He looks to cut off shots’

while taking calculated risks.”
On the other hand, Gaul values
how Luxbacher. treats the team. ,
“Coach treats us like men,” he
said. “He doesn’t check up on us all

the time and he trusts we will do well
in school.” ’

On the field, Gaul may be an

intimidating, unrelenting goalkeeper.-

But off the field, he’s a quick to smile,
bashful 20-year-old marketing major.
“On the field, he’s zoned in. He’s got

a presence in the back,” Churchill

said. “But off the field, he’s a shy guy.

You can’t get him to say a word.”
While his face reddens to the

. notion, Gaul agrees he is “pretty quiet

off the field” _and “very easy-going.”

“I am very open-minded. I get ‘A

along with everyone and just like. to
have a good time,” Gaul said.-

Gaul looks to his mother as his
hero because she has supported him
playing soccer since he was in the
sprite leagues as a youth.

“I look up to my mom a lot,” he
said. “She’s been great with every-
thing in my life and not just soccer.
She’s ‘taught me a lot of things.

Atpractice, Gaul’ believes backup  _, .

goalkeeper Joe Conlan is the most
demanding player. "

“He pushes me harder than any-.
one,” Gaul said about the redshirt
. junior. “I wouldn’t be the keeper I am
today without Joe.” . » V .

Gaul believes the Panthers have

been competitive this year but have

failed to get the lucky bounces.

_ “Last year, we had goals when .:
balls would go in off of a toe and we

would win 1-0,” said Gaul. “This

year, we are playing hard but just not. .

getting the little bounces.” -

While the team may’ be" going
through some growing_ pains this sea-
son, Gaul is confident that it

“I’m hoping to have a great senior

great attitude, but the fact that he
stepped up this season — something
Anderson noticed too.

“He helped shut out [Syracuse

weeks ago,”_Anderson said. “He was
also offensive lineman of the week
after the Notre Dame and Syracuse
games.” ' - .

Despite the recognition, Petitti
does not care about being in the spot-

“The credit can go to the receivers
and running backs,” he said. “People
will notice you if you play good.”

But he does admit that he would
like to earn some recognition before he

leaves Pitt, expressing a desire to be an ,

All—American before he graduates.
Part of earning that honor, he said, is

working hard and being a leader on ‘

and off the field.

Freeman, who has coached a number

of All-Americans during his coaching

‘ career, said he thinks Petitti might

stuff like that,” Freeman said. .“If Rob
matures and learns,,he can do it. He
certainly is big and athletic enough.”

After lettering three times in foot-
ball at New Jersey’s Rumson—Fair
Haven Regional High School, Petitti
was unsure about what to expect once
he arrived at Pitt. .

“I didn’t think there would be as
many people [at the games],” he
admitted. “I was used to playing in
front of a few hundred people in high
school. Here it’s a lot different.”

Petitti continued, saying that since
he did not know what to expect, it has
not been that hard adjusting.

“Here, ‘football is like life,” he

said. “It’s all we do all the time.”

Being around each other most of
the time caused the players to become
friends. All three players agree that this
group of offensive linemen are closely
knit on and off the ﬁeld.

“No one really goes through what
we do and that makes us closer,” Petitti
said.

“We grow. through growing pains
together,” Reed added. “That gives us
an automatic bond.”

According to Anderson, that bond
leads to them hanging out together off
the field and during practice. He
admitted that sometimes they goof
around during practice, but not so

much that they lose focus.
Although this season has not been
what both players and fans had hoped

for, Petitti refuses to give up hope that .

the Panthers can turn’ the year around.

“There are still ﬁve more games
left,” he said. “Things could come
together and we could still end up third
in the Big East this year.”

No matter what happens, the next
four years at Pitt will be a dream come
true for Petitti.

“My dad played serni-pro, he was
my biggest inﬂuence,” Petitti said. “I
watched football all the time when I
was growing up. I’ve always wanted to
play football.”
