Students and faculty milling around
Posvar Hall on Thursday night may have
wondered what was happening inside
room 2M56.

Coming from the room was an emo-
tional song that most passers-by proba-.
bly would not have recognized in a lan-
guage that even fewer understand. Inside
the room, people of many different races
and religions sat around blue and white
tables.

Upon peeking through the open door,
someone would have seen women

wear of Muslim women, and a Muslim
man sitting in the corner, mouthing all
the words that his companion was
singing in the front of the room.

On Thursday night, the Islamic
Studies Group held a dinnercelebrating
the start of the holy month of Ramadan.
To start the dinner, Majid Mohammad
read from the Koran, the holy book of
Is_lam. I

His reading came in the form of the
song that was audible throughout the
halls.

This is the second year that the group
has held a dinner, according to Cem

adorned in hijabs, the traditional head- Ramadan, page4

Fasting brings family together,
event helps others know Islam

Ramadan, page 1

Karaman, president of the Islamic
Studies Group.

Throughout Ramadan, Muslims
are not permitted to eat or drink
between sunrise and sunset.

The purpose is not to starve fol-
lowers of- Islam, but. to create a
stronger connection with the reli-
gion.

“When people fast, they kill
their carnal selves,” Karaman.said.
“They gain spirituality and become
more respectful.”

The basis of
this holy month

answer questions.”

Answering questions and intro-
ducing non-Muslims to the tradition
of Ramadan was the goal of this
evening.

“We want_ people to understand
what [Ramadan] really is,”
Karaman said.

“It is not an event done for our
suffering. There is a reason for our
hunger,” she explained.

Qureshi agreed that it is neces-
sary for non—Islamic people to rec-
ognize the value of this holiday.

“It’s important for them to

‘know why it’s so important to us,”

Qureshi said.
The holiday

1S completely
spiritual, as it
recognizes the
month when the
Quran first
began to be
revealed.

A i s h a
Qureshi, a junior
at Pitt, has been
fasting for the
month of
Ramadan since
she was 7 years
old, even though
Muslims do _not
have to official-

ing the tradition
until they reach

“When people fast,
they kill
their carnal selves.-

n They gain
spirituality and
become more
respectful.”

Cem Karaman
President of the Islamic Studies Group

marks a very
religious time.
While somj'e.peo—
ple were ‘sitting
down to dinner,
-some Muslims
in the back of
the room were
busy performing
the Maghrib.
This is one of

five daily
prayers that
Muslims com-

plete throughout
the day while
facing the holy
city of Mecca. ‘

The prayer is
performed on a
prayer mat and

puberty.
For her, as
well as many

other followers _

of Islam, this month presents an
opportunity for family together-
ness. -
“We eat dinner together,” she
said. “We wake up together usually
before sunrise to eat breakfast. It is
a time-when we make it a point to
get together.”

For Qureshi, the task of fasting
is more difficult than it was at
home. Since she cannot be with her
family, she opts to attend Islamic
Studies Group events.

Another female student who
attends meetings regularly is
Jessica Ehresman, a Catholic fresh-
man. She has been part of Islamic

’ Studies Group since the beginning

of the year. V A

“I have learned a lot through
Islamic Studies Group,” she said.
“Not necessarily through the pre-
sentations, but from the people

themselves. They are sowilling to

 

incorporates dif-
ferent motions
n with the body.

“The prayer exercises both the
mind and the body,” said Arif
Jamal, who also runs the social
work library at Pitt. “The ‘body is
submitting". When someone is on
their knees,,it’s a very humble posi-
tion.” , A ~

When praying, a person will
recite passages from the Quran. The
prayer is recited in a singing man-
ner, and the actual contents of it
depend completely on the person
doing the praying, according to
Jamal.

Events likeythis one serve to
"educate members of the general

public about the religion of Islam,

some attendants said.

‘‘My mother was scared when I

told her that I was learning, about
Islam, because she knew nothing
about it,” Ehresman said. '

“I had misconceptions, as well,’’
she added.

was New nun. um TV

“Harry Potter and the Order of
the Phoenix” has kids hurting. '

In a letter published ‘in Oct. 30’s
New England Journal of Medicine,
Dr. Howard Bennett, a Washington,
D.C. pediatrician, said that three of
his young patients came in complain-
ing of persistent headaches. The
cause, it appeared, was too much
reading. Each child was reading the
latest edition of “Harry Potter,” an
870—page brick of a book, and devel-
oped headaches after poring over it.

But the good doctor wasn’t wor-
ried. He did suggest that the kids lay
off for awhile, but two refused, pre-
ferring painkillers to giving up a

beloved book. The headaches sub-'

sided when the three finished the
tome. - r

‘ Such headaches can result from
sleep deprivation and eyestrain,
reported the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette,
since the muscles of and around the
eye tire if used too much..

We’ve all experienced something
similar — ﬂexing little-used muscles
leads to aches, ones that lessen or
dissipate if properly trained.

More importantly,‘ these kids are
not just exercising their eye muscles;
they’re also exercising their minds.
And we encourage such intellectual

headaches — they indicate active

brains that,’ like muscles, require
training. ‘ «

‘Hopefully, these kids learned

from their “Harry Potter” experience,
and, in addition to their “Hogwarts
headaches,” -will_ go on to have
“Narnia neck-strain” and “Middle-
Earth migraines.” ‘

It’s not that we wish them any
harm. Rather, we ‘want them to
become ﬂuent readers who devour
books, despite all obstacles. All three
were between 8 and 10, and they are
just entering the world of young adult
books, which lay the foundation for a
lifetime love of literature. '

This news is especially hearten-
ing after a Kaiser Foundation study,
released Oct. 28, showed that two-
thirds of young children watch a tele-
vision or use a computer daily, at an
average of two hours a day. Most par-
ents surveyed ‘said that they thought

5 TV and computer time would help

further their children’s education.
But what’s more educational than
a book? Rather than plugging in and
logging on, kids should be taught the
value of books early and often. And
because -books require such concen-
tration, when kids are done with them

they can switch from a mental activi-

ty to a physical one. As one Harvard
doctor said, in the Oct; 30.
Washington Post, kids should be,
“spending time with siblings, with
parents, with mud.” .
' And with books.

EREE SPEECH AND A RABBIT

In a letter to the editor published in The
Pitt News, Pitt student Greg Vaslowski
asked, in response to a piece by columnist
J.P. Fridy, “Do you guys have some- -
thing new to talk about besides’ how

 
 

who will probably spend the rest of their
lives being lowly.
And that’s at the very core of democra-
cy. Free speech means that those on the
bottom rrmg can criticize those on the

Maybe it’s just my liberal When Britain passed the
media conspiracy talking, but I Tea Act, enacting what would

would say: hopefully, no. At .
least until someone else" is in -
oﬂice.

You see, we’re really not
ﬁnding fault with George W.
Bush. We’re ﬁnding fault with
the president, the same way we
did with Bill Clinton and the

No president has ever been perfect, and
none ever will be, so, without fail, they will

. all deserve criticism. When, hopefully soon,

we elect our ﬁrst black president or our ﬁrst
female president, or, to shorten our list, our
ﬁrst president not to be white, male and
Christian,Ihopeyouwillrealizethatthe
media’s criticism of that president is"not
because he or she is a minority. .
Rather, it will be because the president

. is not God and, therefore, is fallib1e,_ and

because that president will be, like this one,
the most prominent and powerful person on
the planet. When he or she drops the ball on
something, it will aifect everyone in this
country, if not the populace of the entire

, planet

Do we hold the president to a higher

"standard than everyone else? Of course.

Because the president is so powerful, we
demand perfection, _and the president will
fall short of that — every day. Therefore, he
or she will probably be  in the
media — every day.

I must admit, there’s a guilty pleasure to
criticizing the most inﬂuential person in the
world, especially for lowly college students

subversive, beneﬁts every one of the U.S.’s

If Vaslowski , had objected on the
grounds that it becomes boring to read one
diatribe after another, his point would have
been more than valid.

Instead, he says,‘ “I bet ifBill Clinton or
Howard Dean had gone after Iraq, this arti-
cle would have never been written.”

It’s possible, but even if that were so,
someone would write a column arguing that
Clinton lacked the military experience to be

not out of hatred, but because we can, and
we revel in having a right that most people
in the world don’t.

Until Allegheny County Chief Executive
Jim Roddey stepped in to ‘issue an extra
$5,000 — bringing the county’s contribution »

Veterans Day parade would join the races in the dead city
traditions graveyard." The Pittsburgh City Council also

chipped in $1,500, in spite of Murphy’s protests, according _

the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette.

Rumors circulated that Murphy plarmed to cut ‘Light

iday season with Christmas lights, as well as the Fourth of
July festivities that draw crowds to Point Park every sum-
mer. '
I have also heard that Murphy isplanning to cut ice
cream, bunnies and bright colors from the city’ of
Pittsburgh. _ '

Although I have no conﬁrmation on that ﬁnal piece of
information, it seems in line with the other decisions
Murphy has made. I realize the city is in serious ﬁnancial
trouble -— trouble that began long before Murphy stepped
into his gloomy-gus mayor’s ofﬁce —— but eliminating

-‘ city of Pittsburgh. _
" “In arriving at these extremely unpleas-

The elimination of the races, the suspension of many
neighborhood athletic and education programs, and the talk
of cutting morale-raising traditions like Light Up Night and
the Fourth of July celebration is disheartening and, perhaps,
poorly plarmed. Light Up Night alone draws thousands of
residents — residents with pockets ﬁrll of holiday savings
just begging to be spent — to Downtown businesses.

Although Light Up Night is safe — private corpora-
tions will support the event — we have bigger problems
ahead. ’

In eliminating city employees, Murphy did a good bit
of damage to the police and emergency medical technician
forces in Pittsburgh. In the same Aug. 7 article cited above,
paramedics union president Jeffrey. Vesci warned that

, «If'Murphy needs to keep_ his constituents ‘

I propose that he entertain us himself. If -

response times would go up and that “people are going to I

get killed,” because of the force’s  resources.
Murphy also removed 102 city police oﬂicers from the
force and, according to Zone 4 Sergeant Benjamin Bogus,
more lay olfs may be coming. , _
. But it’s not fair to pin this all on Murphy. The decisions

he makes reﬂect the choices of the’ entire city government. 3

Two months ago, 551 city employees —— many from the

Public Worksand Parks departnrents:'— lost their jobs , .'

because of Pittsburgh’s ﬁnancial troubles. According to an

‘article that appeared in the Post-"Gazette on Aug. 7, the

majority of those workers were laborers, not "managers.

Until the city is ready to rehire people to do these ser-
vices, it’s time for-our leaders to pitch in. I’d like to see a

job doesn’t sound appealing, maybe she could go watch
over the kiddies who now have to cross busy intersections
without supervision.

If no one in a government oﬁice Downtown is willing

to take on the responsibilities of the people whose jobs they P

eliminated, maybe it’s time they took on a pay cut. 5

But it’s OK; Murphy tells us that these cuts hurt him,
and we feel his pain —— particularly those who are hurt in a
crime or who don’t get the emergency medical treatment
they need.

“It’s okay,” I tell her, and, for the time, it
is. I wear something else; something more
suitable and less wired, a shirt striped with
red glitter that somehow gets all over me and
needs to be scrubbed off. Two days and four
showers later, I still ﬁnd some between my
toes.

But that is not the point. The point is
why, as a liberated woman, taking pride in
self-suﬁiciency, do I want to wedge myself
into something that women spent hundreds
of years trying to escape?

raw material they’re given—in this case my

than control-top stockings and more effec-
tive than, say, sucking it in. Scarlet O’Hara
wore one — shrinking her already impossi-

even though she was not beautiful, men
hardly noticed, because she was, to put it
bluntly, stacked. _

—— the backwards buttons and bra clasps, for
instance, come from a time where women
didn’t dress themselves, a time I returned to
as I made Van zip and rezip my corset.
“Mammy, come here and do up my stays,” I
said. She laughed and complied

But now I do have the option to live
alone; it’s not frowned upon or thought sus-
picious. I can dress myself, in the manner of
my choosing. Provided I protect myself

wear corsets, they were made immobile and

rather than subjects, more decor than citi-

were constantly lightheaded vote?

But, being Halloween season, perhaps
my corset-wearing is not so much a rever-
sion as a costume. We are told that our iden-

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906

PAGE 7

   

This week’s Stupid Question is actually

a response to a vast number of questions, all
about ghosts and Pitt. Apparently, the
Halloween season has some people looking
for some thrills on the cheap. So, the ques-
tion arises —- is Pitt haunted?

The two main ghost stories I’ve heard
take place in the Cathedral of Learning’s

Early American Room and the 12th ﬂoor of ’

Bruce Hall, the current home of the Oﬂice
of Special Events. ’ _

The Cathedral haunting is allegedly
done by the grandmother of Maxine
Bruhns. Brulms is now in charge of the
nationality rooms. Her grandmother, Martha
Jane Poe, was a relative of the famed sus-
pense writer Edgar Allen Poe, so there’s
spookiness all over the story. '

Martha Jane’s wedding quilt, which is
from West Virginia and is the better part of a
century old, currently resides on a bed in the
upstairs part of the Early American Room,
which.isn’t open most days of the year.

A few years ago, a custodian by the

He swept up and pulled the quilt over the
pillows on the bed. As he turned to leave, he
heard a loud thumping noise behind him.
When he turned around, there was an inden-
tation in the pillow, as if someone had lain
there, and the quilt was turned down.
Fearing that people might think he was nuts,
Carter didn’t tell anyone. N

But then, on tours, people started
reporting smells of freshly baked bread in
the room, and there was no explanation for
the aroma. And, ﬁnally, when one tour guide
stopped upstairs to check on the room, she
found the cradle in that room rocking steadi-
ly, when no person had been up there.

These reports prompted Carter to sell
—- err, tell — his story. Local media picked
it up, making Carter something of a celebri-
ty. A radio station eventually arranged to
-spend the night hr the room, which Bruhns
allowed only on the condition that she be
there to ensure security.

Before Bruhns had anived to meet the
crew, they were waiting in the downstairs

Two Pittsburgh neighborhoods feel the ﬂux

' FLUX is a community—based program that helps
promote Pittsburgh artists and neighborhoods that are in

' a state of transition, or “ﬂux.” VV1th this mission in mind,

it’s not difficult to understand why Allentown and Mt.
Oliver were chosen as the neighborhoods for FLUX ll,
which is also FLUX’s 4th Annual Masquerade Ball-,
which takes place, appropriately, on Halloween.

Both neighborhoods have been in a state of ﬂux for
decades, dealing with hard economic times brought on
by businesses leaving the areas and an
always-changing population base.

Allentown especially has been hard
hit over the past decade. After a slight
boom in the early-‘90s, in which busi-
nesses such as an International Youth
Hostel — an addition to the Allentown _
business district that was seen as a sign of
good days ahead — set up shop, there has
been a steady decline of the business dis-
trict and the neighborhood. The Youth
Hostel has closed its doors and the num-
ber -of vacant or otherwise ‘abandoned
properties in the area has steadily been
increasing.

' But this has not stopped people
involved in the futures of Allentown and
Mt. Oliver from believing that great
things lay ahead.

“We have a lot to offer to neighbors.

-nu-an

community,” said Judy Hackel of the Allentown Civic
Association. “We have spent a lot of time and money
looking very hard at our business district. I personally
hope that we have turned around.” N
c For others, like Amy Camp of the South Side Local
Development Company, it’s an important ﬁrst step to just
get people to these neighborhoods.
“The most important things that can happen are the

people that come to the FLUX event — we’re talking‘

 

probably. 1,500 to 2,000 people from around the
Pittsburgh area —- tl1ey’re going to come to these neigh-
borhoods and see and learn about these neighborhoods,
which they otherwise probably might not have,” Camp
said. »

These newcomers to Allentown and Mt. Oliver, who

come to the neighborhood for FLUX, will get a good feel.

for the area, going from one of the ﬁve sites involved in
FLUX 11 to another. There are two sites in Allentown —
Mr. C’s Place and the Youth Hostel, both
on E. Warrington Avenue —.-— and three in

Schwartz House on Brownsville Road and
VFW Post 456 on Hays Avenue. "
“FLUX is very important to Allentown
because there are many people who don’t
know where Allentown is,” Hackel said.
“And this is an opportunity for them to see
how conveniently located to everything
Allentown is.” A
Indeed, all of ‘ these sites are easy to
reach from all areas of the city --
Allentown and Mt. Oliver are located up

also easily accessible from ‘Downtown
Pittsburgh.

Camp reiterated Hackel’s desire to get
people who may not be familiar with the

Flux, page 12 .

It’s Halloween. Everyone, every-
where is being deluged by gruesome
images of zombies, vampires and trashy

pop stars, and has been inundated with_

such imagery — and the crass commer-
cialism of the candy companies —-— since
late August.

Because of that, it’s not my aim to
contribute to this avalanche of horror.
But I can’t help myself.

There’s something out there more
horrifying than the prospect of spending
a night in a haunted house, being eaten
by zombies or watching “Gigli.” It’s the
latest ad campaign from the people over
at the Snuggle fabric softener company.

How, you might be asking, could
Snuggle be so scary? It features a kind-
ly stuffed bear as its mascot/spokesman.
Ah, but you have to look at how the

company is using Snuggle Bear to rec!

ognize the horror. _

Over the summer, print ads and tele-
vision commercials began appearing
that showed Snuggle Bear engaging in a
posh lifestyle of women, sex and Calvin
Klein-esque excess.

One commercial that is particularly
noteworthy begins with a beautiful
woman walking sensuously toward a
huge swimming pool outside of a
Grecian mansion. She dives in, swims
slowly toward the other end of the mas-
sive pool and, even more slowly, gets

The truthis out: Snuggle Bearis aplaya!

out, walking towards a couple of lawn
chairs. When she reaches the chairs, a
towel is handed up to her by an as—yet-
unseen second person. It’s safe to say
it’s a man — everything else about this
commercial looks like a perfume ad, and
a ripped dude in those ads almost always
accompanies a hot lady.

Oh, but not here. No, the person
giving the towel to the woman isn’t a
person at all —— it’s Snuggle Bear!

Snuggle Bear is wearing sunglasses,
loungin’, watching this woman swim,
chillin’ out like a ‘badass — Snuggle
Bear is a playa! Maybe he and Huggy
Bear are related somehow.

For a while‘, these commercials and
ads disappeared but have since come
back. One of the billboard ads, which
can be seen on some busses, has
Snuggle Bear lounging in a canoe with a
different woman and a nondescript bot-
tle of Snuggle is underneath the image,
looking like a perfume bottle.

While this is an extremely clever‘

way of marketing fabric softener —
poking fun at fragrance magnates like
CK and Tommy Hilfiger is always fun,
especially in this case because both
Tommy Girl and Snuggle are, in‘a way,
fragrances — it’s scary as hell. ,

There are the obvious reasons, like
coming to the realization that there are
women out there with a stuffed animal
fetish. Or realizing Snuggle has sold out,
going from a-low-key lifestyle of just
scaring the crap out of people in their
homes when they open their linen clos-
ets to the posh lifestyle of Grecian
manors and fast women. Even worse,
Snuggle is getting around, and it’s not a
given that he’s going to stay as ‘-‘snuggly
soft,” so to speak, after coming into.con—
tact with that many ladies.

But scariest of all is the prospect
that Snuggle Bear,_a stuffed animal and
laundry product mascot, is better at
attracting the ladies than me, a real live
person:

Ok, so maybe it’s just a scary propo-

sition for only me, but I can’t help but
think about how shocking it is that while
I sit in a bar or hang around a party,
Snuggle Bear is out there, taking care of
business, be it by a swimming pool or in
a beached boat. Either way, I’m still out
there giving it the old college try, never

reaching the Snuggle Bear playa apex.

But let me be clear. I don’t want to
imply that I want Snuggle Bear’s.fast
lifestyle. Far from it. I don’t condone the
way Snuggle Bear has been conducting
himself. At his current pace, he’s on
track to be an E! True Hollywood Story.
Oh, sure, he’s living high on the hog

now, but just wait — MC Hammer was-
‘too legit to quit, now look at him.

All I want is to know his secret.
Sure, he’s got fabric softener money, but
there should be more to it. Yes, he can
afford those Greek-looking palaces and
unseaworthy boats that exist just for
show, but what is it that he has that so
few other, real people, do? What’ is his
secret?

It’s probably something that will
never be revealed, but I can hope.

And while I ponder over this mod-
em mystery, all I can do is get my
Snuggle Bear costume ‘for the many
Halloween bashes I’ll be hitting up and

‘hope that a little of the actual Snuggle

called sex appeal rubs off on me. I

THE PITT NEWS — FROM THE DEPTHS  THE WPU

Music so horrible, it’s scary

Horrible Tunes for Halloween

Some albums and songs are so horrible,
it’s downright scary. Here, compiled by the
A & E staif, is a list of the things that you
shouldn’t listen to if you don’t want to have
nightmares.

Matchbox Twenty, More Than You Think
Ibu Are With their single “Unwell,” (how
that made it on the radio, I’ll never know)
the group somehow made a hit about being
ill. And the worst part — it can get worse?
—— is that they use puppets in their music
video. Are they on a budget now? It’s true
what they say, sequels are hardly ever better
than the original, unless you’ Ve watched any
of the “American Pie” ﬁlms. The band
should have quit after their hit “Pus ”
because after listening to this new song of
theirs, I did become rather unwell.

——Ashley McGuire, staff writer

Jessica Simpson, “Sweetest Sin” What in
the world was Jessica Simpson thinking
when she sang “Sweetest Sin?” I’m sure I’m
not the only person out there who’s not inter-
ested in hearing a song about her ﬁrst night
— and you all know what I mean by ﬁrst
night — with her husband Nick Lache. I
mean, now that we know that she is the stu-
pidest person in the world thanks to
“Newlyweds,” the fact that she tries to make
a hit out of a night with Nick is more than I
can handle. And the video for her song? I
think Simpson could make a better sex edu-
cation teacher than whining singer. If I have
to watch or hear Miss Sirnpson’s song one
more time, I think I may be sick Maybe
that’s where Matchbox Twenty drew their
inspiration.

—Ashley McGuire, staﬁ‘ writer

Linkin Park, Meteora There’s simply
something tragically scary about songs talk-
ing about the high school angst of “belong-
ing” when it’s clear that emo is surely what’s
‘ 'p” and “cool” these days. Oh come on
boys, it’s not about being sad that you don’t
ﬁt in, it’s about secretly hating everyone and
promoting self-mutilation! Iet’s not forget:
Who needs true talent when your folks can
just buy you a‘ recording contract and a
bunch of neat junk? Perhaps for their next
album Linkin Park will manage to play
these songs in reverse, add 5,000 effects, and
change the lyrics a tad after busting out the
ol’ Roget’s Thesaurus. Bravissirno!
—Adam Rargf stqﬁ’ writer

Evanescence, “Bring Me to Life” Gothic
themes wiﬂr rap—metal backing vocals, this
is sure to frighten the children of our gener-
ation! Now don’t get me wrong, vocalist
Amy Lee has a decent voice, but jamming
on an E chord with a dude from a nu-metal
band no one cares to have heard — that’s
some wasted talent. Even All Music Guide
dubs this song as “A ﬂawless slice of Linkin

Park—style anguish pop.” Anguish pop.
Gotta love these genres. Well, at least they’ll
have something to write home about Oh.
Neverrnind. ’

—Adam Rauf, staff writer

Staind, 14 Shades of Gray Staind, noted as
the “best” band whose name is intentionally
spelled incorrectly, released their second
album earlier this year and it’s about as bad
as the last one.

Maybe you remember their last effort,
maybe you don’t, but apparently front man
Aaron Lewis decided he’s going to show the
more sensitive side to the already teerning—
with-estrogen Staind. The worst part is that
the sensitive song is for his daughter, Zoe
J ane. Although it was sweet of him to write
a song for his daughter, that doesn’t make
the song good. Not by any means.

And that’s their “best” song.

—Seth Amitin, stay?’ writer

 Aguilera featuring Redman
“Dirrty’ ’ Here’s anoﬂrer opportunity to spell
a word incorrectly for the purposes of being
cool. This little gem comes from Christina
Aguilera’s latest album, “Stripped.” The
album was supposed to be her breakthrough
album, tearing apart her pop culture stardom
and creating a new image for her as a real
well—rounded woman. Of course, this song
has a very one—dimensional tone. The song
isn’t as atrocious as the video; Aguilera
doesn’t do much in it other than dancing
around in her underwear, being “dirrty.”
Worst of all, some people claim it empowers
women, and it obviously does, considering
two women in their bras and undiesrbox
while 40 or so guys huddle around them and
drool. Redrnan sho11ldn’t have taken any
part in this. ‘ j '

—— Seth Amitin, stqﬁ” writer

Godsmack, Faceless When Ben Folds
sang, “Some producer with computers ﬁxes
all my s***ty tracks,” he might as well have
been singing about Godsmack There is no
more awful sound in rock than Sully Ema’s

.voice, and no producer or digital effect on‘

this earth could save us from just how teni-
ble his wounded, barking-dog screech really
is. Even “Serenity,” with its brooding string

cued from lyrics like “When I hold you, I
hold you with my inner chil ” Godsmack
needs to start wearing armor and masks, like
Gwar, and just admit what a hilarious,
pathetic joke of a rock band tl1ey’ve always
been.

—— Jon Zebraskey, staff writer

Limp Bizkit — “Eat You Alive” Limp
Bizkit has reached an all-time low — which
is quite an accomplishment — with “Eat
You Alive,” their ﬁrst single from the new
album Results May Vary. Since the depar-
ture of guitarist Wes Borland, who was the
only talent in the group, Fred Durst has
taken full control of Limp Bizkit and seems
ready to mercifully lead themoﬁ the radio

and into another “What were we thinking?”
chapter of pop music history. Everything
about this song is forgettable, from the stolen
Metallica intro to the eighth grade poetry
breakdown of “I just want to look at youfl
just wantto lookatyou all day. IWILLEAT

The Raveonettes, Whip It On! Ifyou were
aware of The Raveonettes early last year,
chances are you’ve forgotten about ﬂiem by
now. They’ve basically been dismissed as a

. . . . . «

ﬂavor of the monﬂr throwaway, and with
good reason. The ﬁrst time I heard their
debut EP, Whip It On./, I thought I had acci-
dentally hit the repeat button — that’s how
similar their songs are. This record is 21
minutes of droning, vaguely surf Velvet
Underground inspired mishmash. Sadly, in
order to play these simplistic, monotonous

. songs live, this two-piece from Denmark has

to tour with two additional members.
What’s even more frightening is that
these two unoﬂicial members are better
musicians and more dynamic than the regu-
lar members. Live, The Raveonettes are
truly horriﬁc. The two “real” members of
this band are: a high-cheekbone blonde who
haltheartedly pretends to play the bass and
thinks she’s the next Nico and a reedy little
man who smokes’ and leans into the rnicro—
phone stand while “singing.” The most terri-

V fying_ thing of all about my encounterwiﬂr

The Raveonettes early last spring was that
people seemed to enjoy them. I even over-
heard two girls saying that they had ‘come
just for therrr, and that they were better than
the headlining band, the Mooney Suzuki.

Someone get me some smelling salts

us!

THE PITT NEWS — GUIDE FOR THE GHOULISHLY INCLINED

Prison is worse than you think

The second we handed over our
tickets, we were handcuffed together
like the prisoners that were once sen-
tenced on these very grounds: the
West Virginia State Penitentiary,
which is rumored to be haunted.

Through a dark tunnel and into
the penitentiary‘ confines we were
ordered to go. ’ V V

One by one we were released and
shoved into a 6-foot by 3-foot dun-
geon—smelling jail cell by ourselves.

As fast as I could turn around, the
cell door was slamming shut behind
me.

When another girl shrieked,
afraid of "what was to happen next, we
were instructed not to make a; sound.

Guards paced back andforth shin-
ing their ﬂashlights into each cell.

“You okay?” one asked me.

I replied “Yeah, just cold.”

Big mistake! _

“Hey cell number seven is cold.
Send someone down to keep her com-
pany,” he told another guard.

A large man ‘dressed as Jason
casually walkeddown the row of cells
as my door slowly opened. He entered
and the cell door slammed shut once
again. - - . ~

The image of being captive in a
blood-covered jail cell with a man

turned white. - j s

The worst thing was his voice. V

‘My dear friend Elliot kindly told
the guide my name so, “Christineeee”
was heard from every nook and cran-
ny in the dungeon. ’

The Jason-looking character was
over a foot taller than me and 200
pounds heavier. There was nowhere
to run. V

He kept repeating my name over
and over, very slowly.

The eerie, yet soothing, sound of
this creature’s voice, which resem-

i' scared me so muchpthat I clung onto .'

bled that of Tony Todd from the 1992
horror ﬂick “Candyman,” left me
feeling like I was 10 years old again,
huddled in a corner trying to escape
the voice coming from the television.
Only this time, he was breathing
down my neck. _

Jason only loomed over me for

about five minutes, but it felt like an

eternity. _

A guard yelled, “Open cells,” and
all jail cell doors slowly opened —
except for my door and number 14.

We were held back as the group
left, and no one was allowed to wait.
After two or three minutes, we too
were released and lead toward the rest
of the group.

A musty smell wafted into my
nostrils and a smoky haze clouded my
vision as we were guided —— as a
group this time — into the Dungeon
of Horrors. Escaped prisoners and
insane inmates popped up around
every corner as the walls around us

shook with their every thump.

Although ﬁlled with some stereo-

, typical haunted house antics — chain-

saw-chasing killers; the loose, bloody
limbs of those murdered here before
dangling from the ceiling; men lurk-
ing around every corner wearing
ghost-face masks; and shrieking voic-
es —— I never did fully recover from

‘being locked in the cell, so -even sim-

ple tactics made me cling to those

paroundme for dear life.

., -We were led through the dungeon
by our prison guard until we reached

,the'Youters edges of the prison walls
’ and black iron-clad bars:

As soon as I thought I was free
and safe on the solid, un-haunted soils
of West Virginia earth, I heard my
name called again, “Christineee.”

And two hands grabbed my shoul-
ders in an attempt to pull me back in

to the dungeon of horrors for another ,

Station Square’s Fright Fest disappoints

-Looking fora good way to be
scared out of your mind? Then don’t
head to Station Square.

Yes, you’Ve been bombarded
with advertisements on television,
radio and in newspapers about the
Halloween festivities taking‘ place
down at “Station Scare,” but don’t
buy into the hype. The attractions
they boast at the price they charge
definitely don’t measure up to rent-
ing a scary movie at Blockbuster and
watching it alone in the dark. _

First, let’s talk about the price.

. Six dollars just to park? Are you kid-

ding? Six dollars’ will pay" for that
scary movie rental, plus a box of
Junior Mints. You think, well,
maybe she’s being too harsh. After
all, this is the premiere Halloween
‘attraction whose terrifying attributes
I’ve been hearing about relentlessly
from every type of media available.
‘So you park your car and head to
the box office, salivating at the
thought, of being scared witless.
That’s when you realize -that you’re

expected to shell out another $13, to
“i get into the huge tent that’s been set

up, which doesn’t look remotely
warm on a chilly October night. But
you already paid $6 to park and
you’re intent on having a horrifying-

ly good time, so you part‘ with'your_

hard-earned cash.

Once inside, you come to a hor-.

rible realization —— this isn’t Station
Scare. This is a time machine that
_has suddenly transported you back
to those wonderfully awkward days
of mid-adolescence. Everywhere
you turn, you’re surrounded by brat-
ty high school teenagers —— guys in

letterman jackets with spiked hair
and backwards visors and girls
wearing practically nothing in 40-
degree weather who could give the
people running the attractions a
decent challenge for scariness based
on the sheer quantity of black eye-
liner they have
smeared around their eyes.

There are three attractions to
choose from — a haunted maze, a
house of phobias and your standard
haunted house. And then there are
the lines —— be prepared to spend at
least an hour, if not more, in line for

each of these, “scary” attractions. I

wouldn’t think twice about bringing
a 5-year-old to any of these, because
they’re just that lame.

The whole scene is reminiscent
of a shoddy carnival whose owners
decided earlier in the day they Want-
ed to throw together something
scary for Halloween. There’s plenty
of standard fair food —— elephant
ears, hot dogs, lemonade, etc. There
are also plenty of game booths,
including a. “Dunk the Clown” booth
with a guy rivaling Gilbert Gottfried
for most annoying voice and laugh
in the world. There’s even a tattoo
booth, if you decide you absolutely
have to get tatted up in a rickety alu-
minum cube. )

Station Square is a complete let-
down for all of the thrill-seekers in
the world. If your ‘aim this
Halloween is to attend a kick-ass
haunted attraction, consider yourself
warned —— you’re wasting your time
and money by heading down
“Station Scare.”

door slammed behind them, looking them in
the room. By the time Brulms got there, the
crew was in the process of trying to throw

' the latch with a credit card. They were also

freaked out.

Spiritual mediums have made several
trips to the room and described presences as
a little woman with her hair pulled back and
wearing an apron, a description Brulms said
matches her grandmother exactly.

But maybe the best story is that of
Bruhns herself in the room, deciding to see
if it really was her grandmother. On her
grandmother’s wedding day, Feb. 28,
Bruhns said she went into the room for the
night carrying a candle, a ﬂashlight, a bottle
of water and her grandmother’s wedding
nng.
As she lay‘ down for the night in her
sleeping bag and was about to nod off,
Brulms said, she heard a swishing noise
above her head and felt something ﬂy by.
Then there was a loud thumping noise.
Bruhns said she waited a few minutes, para-
lyzed, before turning on her ﬂashlight to see
what had landed nearby.

Just kidding.

It was her water bottle, which had
somehow made its way across the room
from her bag.

Bruhns said she reached a conclusion
after that evening, regarding her grandrnoth-
er’s haunting of the room.

“Grandma,” she said. “You can have
this damn room.”

There are other theories about the room
that tend to involve a German carpenter
searching for his wife. Bruhns said, though,
that she does have an ancestor who was a
carpenter in Germany, so it may ﬁt together
after all.

The 12th ﬂoor of Bruce Hall, on the
other hand, is a little less speciﬁcally haunt-

ed The story is that a woman, who was the
mistress or wife of the builder of the Bruce
apartments, hung herself in a dead-end stair-
way on the top ﬂoor of the building.
Following the suicide, there were reports of
strange things happening to the catering
stafr".

One day, all of the napkins on a banquet
table were mysteriously knocked to the
ﬂoor. Another time, all of the cabinets in the
kitchen started banging so ﬁercely that one
member of the staﬁ had to lock herself in the
bathroom out of fear. Indwd, to this day, the
special events staif is reluctant to even talk
about the haimtings.

There are, no doubt, many other ghost

stories involving Pitt. Mary Schenley has

been said to walk the ﬂoors of the Cathedral

has experienced inexplicable phenomena.
Even here, in The Pitt News office, we have
a ghost who is reported to inhabit 437

Of course,lthey’re all just stories. No

Panther defenders converge on a Rutgers receiver in Pitt’s 42-32 victory over
the Scarlet Knights Earlier this season. On Saturday, Pitt looks to Win at‘

Boston College for the first time since 1989.

Pitt looks to win third
straight Big East game

AUSTIN HERTZOG
Staff Writer

In last season’s matchup
between Pitt and Boston
College, the Panthers rode the
right leg of kicker David Abdul
for four ﬁeld goals en route to a
19-16 overtime victory over the
Golden Eagles. .

Pitt’s lone touchdown was
a seven-yard strike from quar-
terback Rod Ruﬂierford to wide

- receiver Larry Fitzgerald.

Ever since that touchdown
catch, Fitzgerald has found the
end zone in every game, as he
now has caught a touchdown in
13 consecutive games, which
ties the mark set by Michigan
State wide receiver Charles
Rogers last season. With a
touchdown catch this weekend
Fitzgerald can break Rogers’

record, as well the Big East
record for receiving touch-
downs in a season.

Both teams enter this
weekend’s game after victories
last weekend. Pitt defeated
Syracuse at home 34-14 and
Boston College narrowly
defeated Notre Dame 27-25.

The Panthers (5-2 overall,-

2-0 Big East) look to go-3-0 in
the Big East for the second
straight year with a win over the

Golden Eagles (5-3,51-2) this-

weekend. By remaining unbeat-
en in conference play, the
Panthers will keep pace with
Miami or could take sole pos-
session of ﬁrst place in the Big
East with a Miami loss.

For ﬂie Panthers to make
that happen, it will require Pitt
to establish the run, continue its
passing dominance, and come

up with another strong perfor-
mance on defense.

“We have to 11111 the ball
more consistently and execute.
Also, Rod [Rutherford] needs
to continue to show the experi-
ence of a ﬁfth year senior,” head
coach Walt Harris said during
Monday’s Big East
Teleconference. -~

Pitt has struggled on the
ground and could do so again
this week against the Big East’s
second ranked defense/‘against
the rush. Pitt ran for ' just 44
yards on 39 carries last week
against Syracuse.

Conversely, Pitt  had lit- ‘

The second—ranked Pitt Panthers survived a 349-yard
passing day by Flutie and a nightmarish fourth quarter that
included three successive turnovers, to pull out a 29-24 win
before 25,500 at;Alurrmi Stadium.

Forthe second consecutive week, the heavily-favored
Panthers, now 7-0', have shown that the so-called soft,under-
belly of their schedule is iron-plated. At least that’s the way
they’_ve played it, ﬁrst against hapless Syracuse (2-5-1) then
Saturday against Boston College (2-5) anda freshman quar-
terback, however crafty, who was making ' just his third col-
legiate start. ’ T . A

If Dan Marino, Pitt’s HeismanTrophy hopeful, is the
archetypical quarterback, the 5—foot—9-inch, 172-pound
Flutie is the unlikeliest. ,

Saturday, he was also the most effective, relying on guile
and a catalog of shovel passes, laterals and scrambling runs
that aren’t choreographed in a any playbook — guaranteed.

“He was nmning around back there like a little rabbit,”

     

said Pitt linebacker Sal Sunseri. “He did ahell of a job.”

’ “The kid is
fantastic. Unbelievable.
That’s one of the best
V ' games a quarterback

* has played against us,”
Fazio said “He was on
his back throwing and
throwing passes under-
handed.”

For Fazio, an
emotional coach Who,
1* according to one play-
er, cried at halftime of
the Pitt-West Virginia
 game as he implored
" Pitt’s defense to stop its
sloppy play, life on the
sidelines was too
nerve—racking.

A telephone
breakdown forced

hr‘

Fazio out of the coaches’ loft in the press box and onto the
ﬁeld. After a ﬁrst-hand look- at Fazio during the game,
Sunseri said, “I thought he was going to have a stroke.”

It was that close of a game. The outcome went down to

the ﬁnal play with Flutie scrambling and heaving a pass

down ﬁeld that fell incomplete.

The Panthers, who at one junction in the third quarter led
29- 10, were left struggling, smiling and rolling their eyes in
relief after the game. _

“They deserve all the credit in the world. They gave us
a hell of a game,” said Marino, who ended the day with 225
yards passing, completing 19 out of 33 tries.

For the second straight game, Marino had some unchar-
acteristic problems passing — overthrowing receivers, forc-
ing  into double and triple-coverage and interceptions.
His. two interceptions Saturday give him six in the last two
games.

. “The last two weeks, we haven’t been clicking the way
we were earlier,” Marino said. “Everyone has to work
together. Mistakes and turnovers cause the whole team to let
down.” ’

After jumping outto a 29-10 lead, theroof seemed in 9
danger of coming down on the Panthers in the third quarter. .

Boston College, disdaining the run, drove 88 yards in
eight plays for a touchdown, to draw to 29-17 with 11:38 left
in the third quarter. Flutie completed seven of eight passes to

key the drive — including a 30-yardtouchdown pass that ’

Pitt comerback Troy Hill tipped into the hands of Eagle wide
receiver Rob Rikard. , '

James is going to continue to put up outstanding

We’re going to witness a very upset, stressed out, and

He will start moaning and groaning about how he

Men’s soccer ends playoff hopes with loss to Virginia Tech

JACKIE HOTECK
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s soccer team was shut
out for the sixth time this season and the
third time in four games as the No. 19
Virginia Tech defeated the Panthers 6-0.
_ The No. 19 Hokies (12-4-1 Overall,
6-3-0 Big East ) are second in the Big
East and with the win clinched ‘a Big
East Championship. Virginia Tech will
join St. John’s, Rutgers, Notre Dame,
and Seton Hall. in the 2003 Big East
Championships.

The Panthers (5-11-1 overall, 2-6-1
Big East) are tied with Syracuse for 11th
place out of the 14 teams in the Big
East. In order to earn a spot.in the tour-
nament, the Panthers had to defeat

"Virginia Tech.

The Hokies dominated the Panthers
with 27 shots as Pitt only managed to
take six shots and only one was on goal.

Midﬁelder Marco Carrizales led the
attack with "two shots, but . midﬁelder
Brian Madden was the player to land it
on goal with his one shot of the game.

“The score didn’t reﬂect the game.
It was 1-0 for a lot of the game, but the
roof caved in [at the end]. It was disap-
pointing for sure,” head coach Joe
Luxbacher said.

Virginia Tech was awarded a penal-
ty kick in the 15th minute of play for its

first goal of the game, and midﬁelder goalkeeper Jason Cooke ﬁnished the

the ﬁnal two to be scored.

Panther goalie Justin Lowery.
Pitt was able to hold the Hokies

scoreless until the 54th minute of play, 2 at home against Syracuse at 1 p.m.

when Virginia Tech midﬁelder Greg
Roach scored after a Panther player
deﬂected it. . ’ :

The second goal opened. the
ﬂoodgates as Virginia Tech continued
to score the rest of its six goals. Each
of the remaining four goals scored by
the Hokies came within ten minutes
of the next.

' Virginia Tech’s third goal‘ was
passed into the box by forward Bobby .
O’Brien and ﬁnished by Roach for
his second goal of the game in the
69th minute of play. Soon after that,
the Hokies repeated the same play
with a cross by Rogge and the goal
from defensemen Lasse Meitins.

Pitt’s defense collapsed, allowing
the ball to be played across the goal
untouched by a Panther player. for :2
both the ﬁfth and sixth goals. Eric“ 
Vickers scored the ﬁfth goal in the
85th minute followed shortly by
defensemen Greg Herrnandorfer’s
goal in the 89th for the ﬁnal goal of
the game.

Lowerysaved two of the Hokies’
shots, but was scored on four times in
his 84 minutes in the game. Backup

“Neither team has the tournament to

for,” Luxbacher said. ‘“They’re a good

Pitt’s season comes to and end Nov. team, but they’ve had some bad luck
this year. It should be a good game.”

Pitt midﬁelder Mario Carrizales attempts to take the ball around Notre Dame defender during —
a game earlier this season. Carrizales and the Panthers end their season against Syracuse.

average of 145.4 receiving yards per game

receiving mark this season. * '
Rutherford has been torching secon-
daries all season, averaging 294 passing
yards per game and is ranked third in the

country with a 168.5 passing eﬂiciency,t

making the Pitt tandem one of the most dan-
gerous quarterback and receiver combina-
tions in the country. ,

As Fitzgerald continues to demand a
great deal of attention, Rutherford will have
to ﬁnd wide receiver Princell
Brockenbrough and tight end Kris Wilson,
both of whom have been big receiving tar-

an average of 221.9 yards receiving per
game and could be susceptible to the
Panthers’ attack '
Defensively, the Panthers are coming
off of their top statistical performance of the
season, in which they allowed only one
offensive touchdown to Syracuse and kept
Walter Reyes under 100 yards rushing.
Much like Syracuse, Boston College
features a standout nmning back in Derrick
Knight, who leads the Big East in rushing
with 980 yards and averages more than ﬁve
yards per carry. Even with Knight, the
Golden Eagles. and quarterback Quinton
Porter bring a balanced attack Porter has
thrown for 14 touchdowns, second to only
Rutherford in the Big East, and is averaging
210 passing yards per game. Pitt has allowed

an average of 158.9 yards on the ground, but
has made a strong eﬁ’ort to improve in that
category in recent weeks.

Two years ago, the last time the
Panthers traveled to Chestnut Hill, the
Golden Eagles won 45-7, which is Pitt’s
worst defeat during Harris’ seven-year
tenure.

This week Pitt will try to end its streak
of futility at Boston College by winning at
Alumni Stadium, a place that Pitt has been
unable to depart victorious since 1989.

Pitt leads the all—time series between the  

two teams 14-13. g

Flutie not originally

on BC depth chart

Greatest Games, page 14

The two team’s exchanged tumovers
— Pitt’s Pappy Thomas intercepted his sec-
ond pass, but Pitt fumbled the ball back to
Boston College on the very next play. Two
downs later, Flutie hit Rikard — again the
ball was tipped —— for a 17-yard touchdown
pass to pull the Eagles within in ﬁve points
with just under 14 minutes left in the game.

The Panthers turned over the ball three
times on their next three possessions and
Boston College took over all three times in
Pitt territory. The Panther defense stiffened.
Led by a sack and a fumble recovery by
defensive end Michael Woods, the defense
preserved the win.

In their strongest scoring threat, Boston
College hadthe ball and a ﬁrst down on
Pitt’s 8-yard line with 3:48 left, but the
Eagles failed to score after a holding penal-
ty and Woods’ sack pushed ll'l6I‘I1 back John
Cooper hooked a 40-yard ﬁeld goal try wide
to the right.

The narrow win, combined with No. 3
Clernson’s 82-24 massacre of Wake Forest,
could keep the Panthers at No. 2 in the col-
lege football polls. .

Even if the Panthers should inherit the
top spot vacated by Penn State, head coach
Jackie Shenill would have been glad just to
escape with a win.

“The polls will take care of themselves.
The name of the game is not to lose,” he
said. “Twenty years from now, no one’s
going to care what the score was, they’ll just
care who won or lost.” ‘

Shenill admitted the team will have to
improve on its lackluster performance of
late to avoid getting knocked off. The prob-
lem with the team has been too much suc-
cess too easily.

“All of a sudden we’re ranked where
we are. We’re 7-0 and it’s hard to make

, some of our younger people realize they got

there through hard work,” Shenill said.
“Some of our younger people aren’t playing
the same football they played earlier. 8

“The biggest problem is our ‘instant
success,”’ he continued “I don’t know,
maybe they’re sitting back and reading press
clippings.” - ~

“It was just a sloppy game,” tight end
John Brown said “If We’re going to keep
winning, we have to cut ﬂrat stulf out.”

A scheduling change has already. cut
out one unhappy thought for Pitt — the
thought of facing Flutie next year. Pitt does
