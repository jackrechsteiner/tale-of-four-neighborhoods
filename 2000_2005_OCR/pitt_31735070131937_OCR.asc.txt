said her favorite alcoholic beverage was
“anything that is 130—proof.”

The Differential Tuition Rate

‘AkbarAhmed, left, and Judea Pearlsitinfront ofa photo ofslainjoumalist Daniel Pearl. Ina

discussion Thursday night, the two said religious

misunderstanding is often at the root of violence.

Pearl fights hatred to avenge death

MALLORY WOMER
_ Staff Writer

“Hatred took the life of my son,”
Judea Pearl said last Thursday night.
“And hatred I will ﬁght till the end of my
life with vengeance and tenacity. This is
my vision of revenge.”

Pearl’s son is Daniel Pearl, the Wall

, Street Journal reporter whom a Pakistani

extremist group kidnapped on Jan. 23,

_ 2002 in Karachi, Pakistan, then mur-

dered after holding “him captive. The
extremist group videotaped Pearl being
stabbed and dismembered before send-
ing the tape to American officials as
umnistakable proof of his death.

There has been speculation over
whether he was murdered because he
was an American, or because he was
Jewish.

The elder Pearl and Akbar Ahmed
spoke on Thursday night ‘at an event
sponsored by the American Jewish
Community titled “Towards Interfaith
Understanding: A Journey through
Dialogue.” The goal of the evening was
to ﬁght the hatred that exists between
different religions by offering educated
insights from different points of view.
Dr. William Brustein and the University
Center for International Studies brought
the event to Pitt.

Judea Pearl, a Jewish man born in
Tel Aviv, Israel and Ahmed, the Ibn
Khaldun chair of Islamic Studies at
American University in Washington,
D.C., discussed the similarities that exist
between their respective religions, as
well as their sorrow over the loss of a

man they affectionately called Danny.

According to Ahmed, Judaism and
Islam are closely related to each other
because they were both founded in very
similar manners. ‘

“Who is a son of Abraham?” Ahmed
said. “The Jews, the Christians, the
Muslims. Abraham is one of the most
revered prophets in Islam.”

There are 1.3 billion Muslims in the
world in about 5 8 different countries,
and Islam is one of the largest religions
in the world. ‘ .

Ahmed felt the need to defend the '

people of his religion from “people of
the book,” the term used to describe
those whose religion descended ﬁom
Abraham, but are not of Muslim faith.

“What happened [to Darmy] is not
Islam,” Ahmed said in defense of his
religion, “The Quran says taking one
human life is equal to killing all of soci-
ety,” he added, referring to Islam’s
sacred book.

VV1thin the United States, Muslims
are stereotyped to the point where some
people liken Islam to Satanism, accord-
ing to Ahmed.

“Just this dialogue gives us hope on
understanding each other,” Ahmed
added. '

if Danny Pearl is a beacon of hope,
according to Ahmed, because through
his death he became a symbol of the
desire for religious understanding and of
the tragedy that can occur when one faith
is ignorant of another.

Judea Pearl agreed on the impor-p

differential tuition toward financial
aid to help alleviate the cost burden
of tuition for first—time students.

In addition, out—of—state stu-
dents’ base tuition will increase by
$500, while students attending Pitt’s
various branch campuses will face a
$200 tuition increase. I

The $800 difference in rates for
branch students results from differ-
ent cost structures and competitive-
ness at branch campuses, compared
to Pitt’s Oakland campus, according
the plan.

After Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg presented the plan to
raise tuition, the Board’s nominating
committee approved a resolution to
elect Thomas G. Bigley and Suzanne
W. Broadhurst to positions as vice

Chairpersons
Trustees.

Thursday’s meeting also gave
recognition to Alec Stewart, the dean
of ~Pitt’s Honors College. Stewart
chronicled the success of some of
Pitt’s highest achieving students in
receiving the Marshall scholarship.

“Attainment by students is a
measure of educational quality,”
Stewart said. Eight former Pitt stu-
dents, some of whom serve as “dedi-
cated” alumni, were awarded the
prestigious Marshall scholarship,
which Stewart dubbed as “absolute
attainment.”

In response to Pitt’s “unsur-
passed excellence” with the Marshall
scholarship, Prince Andrew, the
Duke of York, will visit Pitt Friday to"
name the University a center for
Marshall success. 5

explain with character, vigor and
enthusiasm.” I

“And they understand how and
why, two years in a leading British
university is so important in achiev-
ing those goals,” he added.

Andrew continued by com-
mending Pitt and defining its goals
and successes as a university.

“The first [of Pitt’s accom-
plished missions] is the way it has
served the needs of greater
Pittsburgh and contributed signifi-
cantly to the 'region’s economic
rebirth,” he said. “The secondis the
way it has emerged as an interna-
tionally renowned university.”

“[Pitt’s] candidates have regu-
larly outperformed students from
some of America’s most famous
universities, particularly those such
as Harvard, Yale, Princeton and the
University of Pennsylvania,”

Andrew added.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
accepted the award on behalf of the
University. . _

“Whenever a lUniversi‘ty of
Pittsburgh student has won a

Marshall Scholarship, the entire /

campus has glowed with pride.
Today, as you recognize their col-
lective achievements, that glow is
even brighter,” Nordenberg said
after recognizing the previous
recipients of Marshall Scholarships
present in the audience.

Pitt’s year of designation coin-

cided with the 50th anniversary of‘

the award’s conception. ‘

“[The] credit belongs to the

University «as a whole,” the prince
said, “but especially to its Honors

College, headed by [Dean] Alec

Stewart, which identified and pre-

pared your Marshall candidates A

with relentless rigor and commit-
ment to the academic excellence

that has produced such great‘

results.”

Also in the Union were rows of

Justin Ghogom and Lisa Roche

told by a tarot card reader.

They said the reader toldthem
that their relationship had much sta-
bility and that they both had great

Not taking the reading serious-
ly, they both admitted that the for-
tune reading was just a fun thing to

tance of communication, as did many
others throughout the night.

A young, female member of the
Pakistani Parliament named Kashmala
Tariq, who contributed to the audience
participation portion of the event, gave
an impassioned speech about life in
Pakistan and the need for action to
accompany dialogue. ‘ y
" “Why are we so enclosed in our own
books?” Tariq asked. “Why don’t we
share our Views?’’ 2

Tariq is one of 72 women in the
Pakistani Parliament and the executive
director ' of Parliamentarians
Commission for Human Rights.

“Pakistan believes in peace,” Tariq
said.’ “One has to be tolerant. You should
learn to respect the views of other peo-
ple. You should learn to be patient.”

The night was not devoid of discus-
sions about Daniel 'Pearl.- Most of the
people who spoke during ‘the audience
participation section offered their condo-
lences to the Judea Pearl.

“What did Danny want to know?” -
asked Umar Ghuman, a special guest 1

speaker and member of the’ Pakistani

Parliament. “What was he doing 10,000 _

miles. away? He was on a quest that led
tohis death, a quest that made him into a
martyr. But a martyr does not die -_—— he

lives on forever.” \

Ghuman is a ,Pakistani-American
who grew up in Philadelphia, Pa. He is
also a , U.-S. citizen — status that

I Pakistani officials asked him to relin-

quish when he ran for Parliament.
Ghuman refused because “all the values
that I have in this life are attributed to my
American morality.” I
Ghuman also made it clear that
something distinguishes the United
States from most of the rest of the world.
' “There were only three nations
formed from people who wanted a place
to practice their own religion: the United
States, Israel and Pakistan,” he said.

While this discussion was the first

step in understanding other religions, .

there are still many more actions that
need to be taken, according to Tariq. .
For some people, there is just a sim-
ple test necessary to satisfy the need for
reassurance that other religions care.
“I gave you a test and you passed it,”

Pearl said to Ahmed at the close of the I

discussion. “I got your book and looked
in the index for Islam. I went to page
l23, I think, and read, ‘as Muslims we
have to understand that the people of
Israel feel under siege.’ For the first time,
I saw empathy.”

In India, authorities are trying —
in light of a glaring scarcity of female
children in relation to males — to step
up efforts against the illegal practice
of aborting female fetuses. I

It’s important for Americans, as
privileged observers, not to jump to
judge either situation.

Miss Afghanistan, Vida Samadzai,
25, was born and raised in
Afghanistan. She came to the United

States in 1996 to avoid the Taliban-

regime, which mandated all women
must wear the ﬂesh-concealing gar-
ment known as a burka.

Now, as a contestant in a beauty
contest, ﬂaunting herself in‘ a tiny
swimsuit for the world to see, she says
she wants to return to Afghanistan to
speak about women’s rights and raise
money for women’s schools.

It’s easy for Americans, more than
150 years after the first women’s
rights convocation in Seneca Falls,
NY, to feel sorry for Samadzai and
call her efforts misguided. After all,
many progressive elements here say
that swimsuit, competitions are
demeaning to women, objectifying
them.

In Samadzai’s case, even being an
object is preferable to being property
—- being someone else’s object. When

on separate learning curves

American women first took to public
beaches in ankle-baring swimsuits, it
was a great stride forward from
repressive modes of thinking that con-

demned them to hiding behind crino-.

lines and corsets.

Afghanistan is not at the same
place as America on the feminist
learning curve. Samadzai’s prancing
in a contest, however distasteful it
may seem to American feminists, is a
huge step in the right direction.

Another step in the right direction
was the outlawing of the process of
using ultrasound to determine the sex
of a fetus —- and abort accordingly —
in India in 1996. Until then billboards
and newspaper ads encouraged par-
ents to have ultrasound and be saved
the financial an_d- cultural burden of
raising daughters: providing a hefty
dowry or bride-price‘ to a prospective
husband’s family, and giving the girl
up completely to the husband’s family
after she is married. Now, women are
becoming scarce and" men are having
difficulty finding wives.

The notion of women’s rights is a
relatively new one in America. In cul-
tures as ancient as India and
Afghanistan, the time they’ve spent
considering the question of rights for
women is a blink of an eye. It would
be unfair to judge them using our stan-
dards, at least at this stage in the
game.

The neverendingsearch for quality

Dear Sex N’ at:

We are ﬂiree attractive young females
who, in our opinion, are deserving of quality
menfolk‘ here at Pitt. We feel that we are
good-looking, intelligent and fun. However,
we seem to lack a selection of
guys with similar attributes. It
seems that college guys like

than companionship with fun
females. These young bache-
lors only seem interested when
extremely intoxicated and most
of them look for commitment-
free sex. Where are all the qual-
ity gentlemen? Is it possible
that college males have an

then look the other direction Monday mom-

ing in class. So what’s the deal? Help us, Sex -

N’at!
Three Cool Chicas

P.S. Most of the guys who DO act inter-
ested are nerdy, stalker-types and they don’t
exactly resemble Brad Pitt (not even close)!

' Dear Chicas:

Before I can even begin to answer your
question, Ihave to take issue with a verbal tic
you use that I’ ve observed a lot lately, and
thatl detest. “Females?” Females are goats
with ovaries. You are women. The distinc-
tion is important. You are more than your
reproductive facilities. The same goes for the
men you are seeking. They are more than
“males.” When applied to humans, those

. words need to remain adjectives, not nouns.

So where can you ﬁnd these glorious
man-creatures?

Not in the Dirty South keg-party dun-
geons you seem to be haunting. If you are
encountering sloppy-drunk manwhores
every time you look for Prince Charming,
you need to reﬁne your hunt.

    

Melissa Meinzer

What is it about you that makes you fun
and intelligent? Is it your passion for foreign
movies? You aren’t likely to meet any other

. fans of Pedro Aldomovar’s ﬁlms at a booty-
shakin’ frat party, and if you do, they aren’t

of you arepalways in top form. Figure out

what kind of man you .want to meet, and,

search accordingly. Get involved in your

who share them with you.

The reason a lot of men you encounter
act wild and reckless is because ‘they are

are still teenagers. To say they are trying to

Salivating over pictures of the objects of desire

At first, I admit, I was a little
ashamed. I couldn’t believe I had
become one of those people — people
who are awake into the early morning
hours, sitting at their computers, surf-
ing the Web for the sort of graphic,
full—color pictures so prevalent in
today’s society.

After finding someone with simi-
lar interests down the hall, I found
myself doing it more and more often.
Somehow, the other afternoon, we
ended up spending at least an hour in
a store a short walk from campus,
flipping through books crammed with
color photos, our mouths watering
with desire. I’ve even found myself
spending embarrassing amounts of
money on the real thing.

Finally, though, I think I am done
hiding my addiction. I am what I am,
and nothing is going to change the
depths of my passion — for food.

I feel better already.

The fact of the matter is, a good
meal is one of the most enjoyable
experiences on earth. The easy access
I had at home to conveniences like
kitchens and supermarkets has sadly
disappeared, to be replaced by a tiny

I craved the ability to acci-

micro-fridge and too many meal
blocks. It’s no surprise, then, that I
am looking through cook- .
books like a twelve-year-
old boy looks through a
copy of Penthouse.

I used to wish I could
be one of those people
with a “birdlike” appetite.

dentally forget to eat for
ten hours at a time, and to
be sated by something
simple and easy, like a bag
of chips and a Slurpee,
when I finally did break
my fast. If I had a"scoop of ice cream
for every time I told myself I would
only eat when I was really hungry or
that I was going to skip snacks,

though, I’d have a sundae big enough‘

to feed all of Tower B.

My stomach, instead of patiently
waiting for me to fill it with some
food and gratefully accepting whatev-
er I give it, rules over my brain like
some sort of crazed dictator. I’m more
likely to remember to go grocery
shopping or eat dinner than to study
for an exam.

  

Emily Kaufman
Columnist _

Sure, every now and then I’m too
busy to eat lunch, or too lazy to make
breakfast, but there is
always a little voice in the
back of my head
which, curiously enough,
sounds a lot like my moth-
er — saying, “you owe
me.” ,

And so I listen. And I
eat. Not that I’m gorging
myself at a different buffet
every night, mind you ——
I’d prefer not ._to gain a
freshman 15. But instead
of buying CDs or posters
or something else calorie—free, my
money is going mostly toward fobd.
I’m learning my way around
Pittsburgh, not so much by street
names, but by where the restaurants
are. '

 

that this is not a bad thing. Loving
good food does not make me a glutton
or doom me to an obese adulthood.
Knowing the difference between a
Chinese apple and a Chinese pear,
and loving the way both taste, is
something to be proud of. There is no

' What I have come to realize is '

need for me to hide my love of food
behind a super-sized tray at the
KenTacoHut or a glass of water and a
tiny salad.

A well-made biryani or tray of
sushi is an instant mood-lifter. Just
walking through a fully stocked pro-
duce or bakery aisle is enough to
make me smile. It may be a little
obsessive, but everyonefs got their
quirks.

Whoever coined the phrase “eat
to live, don’t live to eat” was sorely
mistaken. Eating is not meant to be a
chore, a necessary activity for ingest-
ing proteins and amino acids. Our
tongues have taste buds for a reason,
and there’s no point in letting them go
to waste.

I’m not advocating tackling a
large order of fries at,'the O by your-
self, or eating five square meals a day.

Eat when you’re hungry, and some- '

times when you aren’t just make
sure to enjoy every single delicious
bite.

worries that she isn’t eating enough.

Our demographic has to be the one to take action in2004

The other day I was taking a champagne bath
and reading my mail..Well, actually, I was reading
someone else’s mail. I don’t get any, but the peo-
ple who lived in my apartment before me still
receive a ton of postal correspondence
every day. I know it’s a federal offense
to read other people’s mail, but the ille-
gality of it makes the champagne bath
all the more decadent. That and the
chocolate coveredloganberries.

To my surprise, a letter came for
me, telling me I was a registered non-
affiliated voter in Allegheny County. I
tried to sift back through champagne-
soaked memories to when I had regis-
tered, but the strain of it made me fart
into the bath.

Then I remembered that a friend of
mine had given me a form to fill out and then did
all the hard stuff for me, like not losing it immedi-
ately and mailing it to the voter application place.
Thus, I am now enabled to do my most sacred duty
as an American citizen.

Since I turned eighteen, I’ve had no inclination
to become a voter. If I started voting, it would only
be a matter of time. until I’d have to start doing
other responsible things like jury duty. Even when
George Jr. was elected president and I became
worried about the astuteness of the American pub-
lic’s decision-making skills, I never completely
lost faith. People would come to their senses once
they» saw what a monkey lil’ George was and
they’d give him the boot just like they did with his
more intelligent Pops.

  

Seth Stein ac er
Columnist

Then Sept. 11, 2001 occurred and gave our
president the distraction he needed to divert our
attention. Americans took to vengeance, paranoia,
and blind self-righteousness like ﬂies to doo—doo.
It’s not surprising. Look how readily we
embraced the Macarena_ and the WB
network. ‘

Now our economy is slow and gets
picked on by the other economies at
school. A growing number of Americans
and Iraqis are dying’ because Bush
pushed us into an unjustified war.
Despite this, there is a very real chance
George W. Bush is going to be re-elect-
ed.

 

A larger percentage of Americans
than I thought must be doing crystal
_meth. The man lied to us about Iraq
having ‘weapons of mass destruction, and is
responsible for so much death and destruction, yet
there was no call for impeachment. We triedito
impeach Clintonbecause he got head from a fat
girl and lied to us about it. I guess making us bomb
fodder is fine but keeping the nasty details of your
sex life private is unacceptable.

I’ve‘come to realize that I have to start voting.
I owe it to my fellow citizens to vote Bush out of
office. I also need to make a difference for myself.
It’d be really nice to graduate college and enter
into a vibrant economy with lots of opportunity
and equality. If I get stuck doing somethingreally
boring and unfulfilling for the rest of my life, I’ll
snap and take a few people with me — that I

promise. \

_- Most of all, I owe a debt tolater generations of
Americans. Yes, the children of America need me
to create a future worth living in fdr them. I want
kids, yours and mine, to grow up well educated by
the public school system, without hatred for other
cultures, free of misconceptions about pre-marital
sex, and with genetically enhanced superhuman
strength.

' I’ll be voting come election time. And get this:
I don’t have to do any of the extra stuff like voting
in the primaries-because I’m “independent.” 'I’m
not sure whom I’ll vote for unless Jesse Jackson
decides to run. But I know Bush will not be getting
my support and I sincerely hope he has to pack his
bags and go back to. his kick-ass ranch and his mil-
lions of oily dollars. It’s not that I hate the guy —
I’m no hater. I’m sure he’ll be content when he has
lots of free time to play Tiger Woods Golf on his

PS2. -I just don’t want him running the country and .

making decisions that affect me in any way.
I. think the real momentum for ousting Bush

has to come from our demographic. After all,,

we’re the near future. Nobody listens to whiney
left-leaning columnists and protester sissies. It’s

up to us to take the bull by the balls. The govem-A

ment can’t ignore the roar of millions of chads

being punched,’ demanding fair and competent,

leadership. If things don’t get better I’ll have to

stop taking champagne baths and instead soak in
N gallons of Pabst. '

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906'

CHAD EBERLE

world premiere of this showcase of

Cutting class and roaming toToronto

Senior Staff Writer

The Toronto Intemational Fihn Festival
(Sept. 4-13) is a beautiful thing. Over 300
ﬁlms in a little over a week. I caught 13 in
my four—day trip. All of them were in grand
theaters, all sold—out, packed with respect-
ful, enthusiastic “ﬁlm people.” Most were
introduced by their directors and/or actors.
It was a blast. When I couldn’t possibly
miss any more classes, I had to pry myself
away from the festival. Afterward, going to
the movies in Pittsburgh was almost
unthinkable for a while — all the fanfare of
the festival had spoiled me.

Here’s a look at 9 high-proﬁle North
American premieres I caught at the festival.

“Ihe Human Stainz” Director Robert
Benton (“Nobody’s Foo ,” “Kramer vs.
Kramer”) tinns Philip Roth’s novel into a
ﬁlm that’s not the sum of its parts, but_has
enough going for it to make it worthwhile.
Anthony Hopkins plays Coleman Silk, a
respected professor who falls victim to his
university’s wrong—headed political correct-
ness when he’s ﬁred for innocently inquir-
ing whether a couple of absentee students
are “spoo ,” as in “ghosts;” ‘incidentally,
the students turn out to be African
Americans. Coleman has a secret past that
makes his being labeled a racist even more
outrageous —Ahe rerninisces -‘on his painful
youth as he romances Faunia (Nicole
Kidman, sexy as ever), a suicidal janitor
half his age. While the ﬁlm’s various plot-
lines never quite gel, the ﬁlm is handsome-
ly shot and superbly acted.” Ed Harris is a
standout as Faunia’s lunatic ex—husband.
(October 31)

“I Love Your Work:” The festival hosted the

Hollywood twentysomethings—on—the—rise
— Giovanni Ribisi, Franka Potente, Joshua
Jackson, Jason Lee, Christina Ricci, Nicky
Katt and more — directed by busy young
actor Adam Goldberg. You may not know
it, but you’ve seen Goldberg in “Dazed and
Confused,” “Saving Private Ryan” and a
ton of other ﬁlms. The plot follows Gray
Evans (Ribisi) — a mega movie star with a
mega movie star wife (Potente) — who’s
paranoid about fan obsession; he’s sure a
stalker is going to kill him at any moment
Goldberg shows some ﬁlmrnaking
prowess, but the second half of his ﬁlm is
way too heavy—handed. Watching the ﬁlm,
a look from the other side at our obsession
with celebrities, immediately after gawking

V at Clnistina Ricci in person was a bit weird. p

(TBA 2004) '

“Elephant” Fresh off top ﬁlm honors at the
Carmes Film Festival, Gus Van Sant’s
(“Drugstore Cowboy,” “Good Will
Hunting”) school-shooting drama took
many ﬁlmgoers aback at its North
American premiere. It is a stark, uncluttered
look at a single day when tragedy —-— close-
ly resembling that of Columbine — strikes
an anonymous high school. Non—actors
play honest, unforced personalities you’ll
actually recognize from your high school
Van Sant’s ﬁlm is comprised mainly of
long, slow tracking shots that eventually
start intersecting, creating a very. tangible
sense of a few key points in time and space.
He manipulates time a great deal though —
we know what’s coming and he keeps hold-
ing it back, pumping up the dread. The ﬁlm
is worth its buzz; Van Sant’s best in years
and the most powerful ﬁlm I saw at the fes-
tival. (Slated to open in Pittsburgh .
November 21)

CQURTESY FlNE£.INE FEATUR

December 26.

“Dogville:” My favorite of the festival. I
have a hard—to-deﬁne love/fear relationship
with the work of director Lars Von Trier
(“Breaking the Waves,” “Dancer in the
Dar ”); his ﬁlms are usually as alive as any
art you’ll ﬁnd these days, but also painful.
They are bleak, harrowing journeys. I
approached his “Dogville,” a three—hour
beast that left audiences scratching their
heads at Cannes, with much trepidation. It is

a long, slow cinematic bum, but also a‘ stag- -

gering, unforgettable piece of work Von
Trier creates his tiny American town of
Dogville on a soundstage, without proper
sets. The houses are without walls — to our
eyes at least — and represented only by
chalk outlines. The concept takes a while to
settle into, but achieves great effect. Nicole
Kidman stars as Grace, a mysterious
woman seeking sanctuary in Dogville from
we-don’t-know-what (the law we pre-

sume). The townspeople agree to give her .

refuge, but only if she’ll help them with
their daily tasks. As the arrangement plays
out, the townspeople are slowly corrupted
by their ability to control Grace, to make her
do whatever they want under threat of being
cast off. Kidman once again shines in an
oﬂbeat role. And the ending — you won’t
believe your eyes. (TBA 2004)

I “Coffee & Cigarettesz” Imagine my disap-

pointment — the ﬁlm that Jim Jarmusch,
oddball genius and one of my favorite
directors, has been piecing together since
the ‘80s turns out to be no better than hit.-
and-rniss. Still, ‘there are plenty of laughs in
the ﬁlrrr, essentially a collection of shorts --

all featuring characters chatting over coffee
and cigarettes — starring ‘various cool
names .including Roberto Benigni, Cate

Blanchett, Steve Buscemi, Bill Murray, _’
Iggy Pop, the RZA, Tom Waits, the White

Stripes and Steven Wright. And the ﬁlm’s
North American premiere was the place to
be at the festival + Jarmusch was there —
with an entourage — to present it and take
questions after, and many celebs showed up
just to check it out; Watching a ﬁlm with
Francis Ford Coppola sitting a few rows
behind me was truly surreal. (TBA 2004)

“Haute Tension” 3 (aka “Switchblade
Romance”): Okay, I snuck this one in here.
It was hardly a high-proﬁle premiere.
Rather, it was part of the supercool
“Midnight Madness” series of screenings,

where" they put the festival’s (more, um,‘ ‘

“colorful” ﬁlrrrs, usually bizarre and gory
horror and sci-ﬁ ﬂicks. Seeing .4“I-Iaute
Tension,” a ferocious French slasher ﬁlm
about two young girls in a secluded country

home descended upon by a murderous-

truck driver, in the midst of so much classy,
intellectual cinema was a riot — something
like a shot of whiskey at aftemoon tea. As
director Alexandre Aja warned in his intro-
duction,'there’s not much wony about cen-
sorship in France, so blood ﬂows ﬁeely in
the ﬁlm. Though_I’d wager it’s far too gory
to play American movie theaters, the ﬁlm
has been picked up by -Lion’s Gate, the stu-
dio that recently released “Cabin Fever,” for
some level of release next spring. '

If ever a ‘subject demanded a docu-
mentary that does nothing but poke fun at
it, it’s those highway safety ﬁlms made
between the mid-‘50s and mid-‘70s, which
are still shown to teenagers today.

Any kind of ﬁlm, and any type of
ﬁlmmaker, that promotes terms like “teeni-
cide” —~ which, according to the highway
safety ﬁlm “Last Date,” is the “ﬁne art of
killing yourself and maybe somebody else
before you reach the age of 20” — begs
ridicule. Teenicide? Come on.

Filmmaker Bret Wood presents the
subject, at least initially, with an eye
toward this absurdity in the ﬁlms. The
inclusion of clips from a number of these
ﬁlms" that show things like teenicide and
prologues that read, “Most of the actors in
these movies are bad actors and received
top billing only on a tombstone. They paid
a terriﬁc price to bein these movies, they
paid withvtheir lives,” show Wood’s»ability
to single out these campy moments. And
after he begins a more critical look at the
ﬁlms, Wood still ﬁnds places to show the
ridiculousness of them by showing scenes
narrated by Jimmy Stewart and others with
then-California governor Ronald Reagan.

More important to the ﬁlm, though, is
the implicit harsh critique of not only the
-safety ﬁlms, created under the supervision
of the Highway Safety Foundation, but
also those involved in their creation.

who ﬁlmed many of the gruesome images

' of the death and carnage of horriﬁc car

crashes in Ohio, look back fondly on their
work. There is a point where one man gets
choked up when recalling ﬁnding a dead
baby in the wreckage of one accident, but
there is a general feeling that they were
capitalizing on people’s poor decisions and
their grim consequences during the ‘50s,
‘60s and ‘70s, despite whatever their inten-
tions were. ‘ ‘

Similarly, another man who was once
a police captain in Ohio becomes extreme-
ly defensive about the project and the peo-
ple who created it. He feels as though

. they’ve gotten a bad‘ rap in the armals of

history and that shouldn’t be the case. He,
like the two cameramen, feels the work of
the Foundation saved numerous lives.
Wood, however, paints the one-time cap-
tain and two cameramen unsympathetical—
ly.

Then there is the inclusion of
moments from the ﬁlm “Options to Live.”
In two separate clips, the narrator of
“Options to Live” says, “We showed you
pain. But we didn’t think seeing was
enough. So, we let you hear the sound of
pain,” and “Perhaps one scene you saw or
one word you heard made you a more
careful driver.” In the way Wood presents
the material in “Hell’s Highway,” all that
these ﬁlms accomplished was making kids

2 sick from the graphic images, and messing

them up long term by subjecting them to
such human suffering.

But, despite these moments, the audi-
ence has to wonder what exactly Wood’s
position on the ﬁlms is. . »

Glitz, glamour, stars and some good films abound at film festival

Toronto, page 10 .

“Love Actuallyz” Man, this is a whole lot of romantic com-'
edy. Cute, rriajor studio romantic comedy. And just not what
I was looking for at the time. It’s a mostly decent, occa-
sionally clever ﬁlm directed by Richard Curtis, writer of
several hit British/American lovefests, including “Four
Weddings and a Fune ” and “Bridget Jones’s Diary.” But
in the context of the festival, it had so little edge thatl strug-
gled to pay attention. -It’s got an impressive cast — includ-
ing Hugh Grant, Liam Neeson, Alan Rickman, Emma
Thompson, Laura Linney, Keira Knightley, Billy Bob
Thornton and more — and it could be a big hit this holiday
season, but I don’t think I could sit through it again.
(November 7)

“Z1 Grams:” All the makings: exciting cast (Sean Penn,

-“shocking but never exploitative.” Either

(know exactly what his position in that

Benicio Del Tom and Naomi Watts), exciting director
(Alejandro Gonzalez Inariitu, following up his assured
debut, “Amores Perros”) and way cool title (not the drug
reference it seems to’ be, but rather a reference to the fact
that everyone’s bodyweight drops 21 grams at the moment
of death). The ﬁrst half is exciting — the ﬁlm frantically
cuts between several dilferent time periods without cluing
you in on the proper chronology. If you thought “Pulp
Fiction” was fractured, you’ ve seen nothing yet. After the
halfway point, though, once you’ ve pretty much ﬁgured out
the timeline, there’s nothing left to discover in the ﬁlm and
the conclusion is a brooding drag. The plot swirls around a
car accident that kills Watts’ character’s husband, gets
Penn’s a heart and sends Del Toro’s to jail, and one other
event — whether it happens before or after the accident, we
don’t know at ﬁrst -— that causes the three to intersect one
more time. Bummer. (Slated to open in Pittsburgh

December 26)

“The Company:” When iconic ‘70s director Robert Altman
misses the mark, he misses big time. Why he chose to
indulge Neve Campbe1l’s ballet fantasy —— the actress stars
in the ﬁlm, does all her own dancing, and receives “story
by” credit — I’ll never understand. Partway into the ﬁlm, I
was shocked to realize that “The Company” is half concert
ﬁlm, frequently coming to a halt for lengthy ballet
sequences. They look great, and the ﬁrst few are interesting,
but after that, I’d had enough. Plot is minimal; what little
there is takes an unstructured look behind the scenes of a

' ballet company, focusing somewhat on Campbell’s charac-

ter. There is some nice photography and overlapping dia-
logue that’s vintage Altman, and Malcolm McDowell gives
his best performance in ages, but most of timel felt like
nodding off. (Opens inlirnited release December 25)

she wasn’t watching the same safety ﬁlms
or the person writing the narration wasn’t
—— the images of dead and dying people
are certainly portrayed in an exploitative
way, in that their deaths and suffering are
being used to intimidate kids —- not nec-
essarily into driving slower, but into feel-
ing scared and sick. '

These safety ﬁlms raise a larger ’ques-
tion about such footage, whether it’s
exploitative by nature, twisted that way by
the makers of the /safety ﬁlms or not
exploitative at all. But it’s not one Wood
answers here, and, with such narration in
his own ﬁlm, surely cannot answer.

“Hell’s Highway” is an interesting
documentary, m that it discusses a relic of
American pop culture that most would not
link to today’s cultural landscape. But the
safety ﬁlms’ portrayal of graphic violence,
death and carnage is one that had a direct
result on current violent ﬁlm and enter-
tainment, and the safety ﬁlms are still
important to the debate concerning cine-
matic violence. It’s too bad Wood doesn’t

debate is_.

Defense leads Pitt to victory, 34-14

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

Rod Rutherford threw, for over 300
yards and Larry Fitzgerald set a new Big
East record for receiving touchdowns in a
season as Pitt defeated Syracuse, 34-14, in
front of a Homecoming crowd at Heinz
Field.

But believe it or not, it was the ques-
tionable Panther defense that led the way to
Pitt’s second victory over the Orangemen in
the past 13 seasons on Saturday.

VV1th the game knotted at 14 in the sec-
ond quarter, Orangemen quarterback R].
Anderson took the hand-off on second and
eight, and ran the option to the left The
Panther defense swarmed toward Anderson
causing him to lateral the ball short of mm-
ning back Walter Reyes. The ball bounced
off the ground and into the hands of Panther
comerback Bernard Lay, who ran it 20 yards
for Pitt’s ﬁrst defensive touchdown on the
year.

Pitt (5-2 Overall, 2-0 Big East) kept
Syracuse out of Panther territory throughout
most of the game. AﬁerAnderson ﬁnished a
12—play, 80-yard drive with a 2-yard rushing
touchdown, Syracuse reached Panther terri-
tory only two more times and never saw the
red zone again.

Syracuse (4—3, 1-2) was held to 59 yards
on its ﬁnal 12 drives of the game. Those ﬁnal

twelve drives ended with two interceptions,“

one fumble, six punts and two turnovers on
downs. _

The Pitt defense stepped up and held the
potent Syracuse offense to a meager 195
total yards; an offense which averaged 407.3
yards per game coming into the contest

The Panthers defense looked better in

1 all aspects of the game. ‘ 1

.“It comesdown to execution,” defen-
sive tackle Dan Stephens said “We played
every quarter great”

Syracuse ran for 146 yards on the
ground, but it was on 39 carries —— only 3.7
yards per carry. Reyes, one of the nation’s
best running backs, managed only 95 yards
rushing in the game. ,

The Pitt pass defense was also a key fac-
tor in the game. The Panther secondary, led
by comerback Shawntae Spencer who had
an acrobatic interception and three pass
deﬂections in the game, contained the
Syracuse air attack to 49 yards.

“[Spencer] made a bunch of big plays,”
coach Walt Harris said. Harris accredited the
better defensive play to harder work on the
practice ﬁeld that carried over into the game.

“I credit those interceptions to the guys .

up front,” Spencer said of Pitt’s two inter-

ceptions. Anderson had yet to throw an inter-
ception all year. A -

' The game did not start out well for the
Pitt offense. .

On ﬁrst and 10 from thePanther 36-
yard line, quarterback Rod Rutherford com-
pleted a 9-yard pass to full back Lousaka ’i
Polite. An offensive pass interference call
would negate the play and put the Panthers
in a ﬁrst—and-25 situation. On the very next
play, Rutherford dropped back to pass, but
was sacked for a loss of 16 yards. That led to
an unimaginable second and 41. '

Unable to reach the ﬁrst down, Pitt was
forced to punt the ball away. Punter Andy
Lee fumbled the snap and the Orangemen
swarmed to the loose ball. Steve Gregory
recovered the fumble for Syracuse and ran it
in for the 7-yard touchdown.

On the next possession, the Pitt offense
returned to the ﬁeld with a. better sense of
direction Rutherford moved the offense 80
yards, capping the drive olf with a 3—yard
touchdown pass to receiver Larry Fitzgerald.

Rutherford saw‘ that Syracuse left
Fitzgerald in one-on-one coverage and put
the ball where only his receiver could get it.

Fitzgerald also demonstrated great bal-
ance on the play, as he was tripped up when

Marshall contemplating switch to Conference USA

BRAD MYERS
The Parthenon (Marshall U.)

(U-WIRE) HUNTINGTON, W.Va.
—‘—— It all started with Miami and
Virginia Tech leaving, the Big East
Conference for the Atlantic Coast
Conference and the domino effect
continues to be felt.

. Teams are packing up and
switching conferences V for more
With Louisville and
Cincinnati drawing serious interest
in the Big East, Conference USA
finds itself searching for replace-
ment teams.

On Oct. 22, the Tampa Tribune
reported that Marshall and four other
schools Southern Methodist,
Rice, Tulsa and Central Florida -
would be invited to join Conference

- USA.

If Marshall joins Conference
USA, there will be many changes the
Herd will face in all sports. Marshall
will leave ‘behind old opponents
Toledo, Miami of Ohio and Akron,
and begin new rivalries with teams
like Texas Christian, Southern Miss,
East Carolina and Memphis. '

, While Marshallfans have opin-
ions on what the Herd should do,

* most of Marshall’s head coaches are

keeping quietabout a conference
change. A

, “I think the MAC-has better,
stronger teams, but I think in order
to getmore respect and publicity,

.about

Conference USA is the right move,”
said Matt Hutchison, a sophomore
physical therapy major. .

Head football coach Bob Pruett
and Athletic Director Bob Marcum
are referring all questions to
Marshall University President Dan
Angel. -

Head basketball coach Ron Jirsai

seems to be the‘ only one talking
the potential move ’ to
Conference USA. .
“I feel we’re up to the challenge
no matter where we land, and
Conference USA is certainly a chal-
lenge,’’ Jirsa said to The Associated

Press.

Conference USA is looking to
have a l2—team conference that par-
ticipates in all sports, but will have
to wait for the Big East to make the
first move. Current Conference USA
schools such as Louisville,
Cincinnati, Marquette and DePaul
could be headed to the Big East.

If these teams do leave then the
focus will switch to mid—major
schools like Marshall, Central
Florida and South Florida. No one
knows the exact effects that are to
come if the Herd decide to join
Conference USA, but students and

fans alike ‘already seemed excited

-about the possibilities.

“I think moving to Conference
USA will give us better competition
with better teams that we would be
playing,” said" Tyrone Saunders, a
junior marketing major. “There
would also be better bowl games we
would go to and it would bring more
money to Marshall University.”

Marshall’s campus is full of talk
about conference jumping and what
the Herd should do. For now, the
university and all involved must
wait for a final decision that should
be announced soon.

running to the comer, but recovered in time to.
stay on his feet and pull in the pass for his record-
breaking touchdown catch.

The touchdown was Fitzgerald’s 14th of the
season, breaking the Big East record held by for-
mer Pitt receiver Terry Murphy, and tying the
record, at 13, for consecutive games with a
touchdown.

Fitzgerald had a key play earlier in the drive
that moved the offense into scoring position.
Rutherford ran a play-action fake, causing the
safeties to bite in on the play and Fitzgerald was
left in man coverage. He ran a ﬂy pattern down
the right side of the ﬁeld, Rutherford tossed it up
and the receiver came down with the ball.

Following the long Syracuse drive that put
the Oiangemen up 14-7, Rutherford continued
his success in the air, hitling Fitzgerald for a 35-
yard gain. Fitzgerald then sniffed out a large hole
in the Syracuse zone coverage and Rutherford
laid the ball nicely into his’ hands for a 43-yard
gain.
Three plays later, Rutherford found tight
end Kris Wilson in the end zone between two
Syracuse defenders. Wilson was hit hard in the
air by the safety, but he still pulledthe high pass
out of the air to tie the game at 14 early in the sec-
ond quarter.

The Pitt oﬂ°ense wouldn’t strike again until
late in the third quarter, with the score 21-14.
Rutherford ﬁnished olf a 67-yard drive with a 7-

yard touchdown pass to Fitzgerald.

Fitzgerald caught the ball on the 2-yard line
and powered the ball into the end zone with cor-
nerback Thomas Whitﬁeld on his back to put Pitt
up 28-14.

The Panthers would drive deep into
Syracuse tenitory tvvioe in the fourth quarter and
come away with two David Abdul ﬁeld goals
from distances of 30 and 43 yards. Abdul was
only four for 10 coming into the game.’

Harris was happy with his special teams
play. Besides the fumble by Lee early in the
game, the Pitt punter had a good game, pinning

the Orangemen, inside the 20-yard line four

 was our best game of the season so
far,” said Rutherford, who was 21-of-32 for 310
yards, three touchdowns and one interception.
Rutherford admitted he had an ankle injury and
asore archinhisfoottliathasbotheredhimin
previous weeks, but said he was completely
healthy when he stepped onto the ﬁeld on
Saturday. ‘

“We played strong all four quarters. All
three phases, we did a good job,” Fitzgerald said

Even though the consensus was that the
Panthers played well in all aspects of the game,
Pitt’s running game still struggled with only 44
rushing yards.

“It wasn’t as bad as it looked,” Harris said.

The Panthers travel to Boston College next
Saturday where they look to continue their Big
East success.

with a touchdown.

“You can’t say enough about
Larry Fitzgerald and- what he’s
accomplished,” head coach Walt
Harris said. ,

According to - Harris, Terry
Murphy —— former Panther wide
receiver and Big East record holder
for touchdowns in a single season
with 13 —— called some time during
the week before the game to wish the

-team luck.

Fitzgerald’s chase if the confer-
ence record. for 100—yard games
places him statistically against anoth-

er one-time Pitt receiver, Antonio

Bryant. - .
Bryant finished his collegiate
career with a total of 13 and current-

ly holds the Big East record.
Fitzgerald, however, has the dis-

tinct honor of being the only receiver

ever to amass two 1,000-yard receiv-A -

ing seasons in the Big East.

“It’s never routine. It’s just me
doing my part,” Fitzgerald said.
“Sometimes I’m called on more than
others, but whenever I’m called on I
have to go out there and make sure
I’m doing my assignment.”

Fitzgerald’s assignment ' on
Satifrday appeared to be breaking
through Syracuse’s defense whenev-
er it came at him with man coverage.

With seven minutes and 34 sec-
onds left in the first quarter, he recov-
ered from tripping on a defender to
catch a 3-yard touchdown pass from
quarterback Rod Rutherford to set up
a game-tying kick from David

. Abdul. ‘r _
 “You’re not going. to see too.

many better receivers than him at this
level,’’ said Pitt defensive back
Shawntae Spencer, who matched up
against Fitzgerald a number of times
last week in practice. . ’_ F .
Against Boston College neirt
week, Fitzgerald will have a chance
to claim the NCAA record, as his

alone, for consecutive games with a --

receiving touchdown. . .
Currently, he shares the record
with Michigan State’s Charles

Rogers, who set the bar at 13 games _

in 2002. _.

Boston College has given up 14
passing touchdowns and an average
of 221.9 receiving yards per game
this season in eight games.

With ﬁve games remaining in Pitt’s
schedule —— plus a potential bowl
game —— Fitzgerald could end up
extending his records well beyond
their previous marks.

I “But records are meant to be bro-

ken, and who’s to say somebody _

doesn’t come by and break! my
record,” Fitzgerald said, seemingly
taking it all in stride.
