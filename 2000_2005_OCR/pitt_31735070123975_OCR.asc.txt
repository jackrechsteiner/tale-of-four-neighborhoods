I Griinbaum

resigns his

position in

philosophy

dolf Griinbaum, who

led the transformation

f Pitt’s Department of
Philosophy from an academic
backwater into one of North

America’s elite philosophy units, ‘

severed his affiliation with the
department April 26.
G_riinbaum, one of the
University’s most celebrated
scholars, called his resignation
the culmination, of years of
“escalating alienation” from the
department.
r I     ~ '- 
tenured Andrew W. Mellon
Professor of Philosophy of ‘Sci-
ence, as chair of the University’s
Center for Philosophy of Science
' (which Griinbaum founded when
' he came to Pitt in 1960), and as
a‘ professor in the Department of
History and Philosophy of Sci-

       

ence (HP S) and in the psychiatry -

department. . -

“This is an amicable divorce,”
Griinbaum told the University
Times. “I continue to enjoy the
warmest and most_ cordial per-
sonal relations with people in the
philosophy department.”

But Griinbaum also citedwhat
he called “festering ills” within
the department that drove him
to resign, including:

0 Refusals by most philoso-
phy faculty to give examinations.
Instead, most philosophy faculty
evaluate students based mainly
on term papers. According to
Griinbaum (who requires exams

’ in his courses), this over—reliance

on term papers encourages stu-
dents to focus on course material
related to their papers — at the
expense _of gaining a broad-
based grounding in philosophi-
cal concepts. “On top of this,”
Griinbaum said, “some faculty
have been vastly” delinquent
in returning papers‘ within a
reasonable amount of time and
with appropriate annotations,” a
complaint also voiced by graduate
students in a Jan. 22 open letter
to philosophy faculty;

0 VVhat Griinbaum called “a
poverty of educational leader-
ship” within the department.
“There is a tendency to treat
students like customers, and the
customer is always right,” he said.

ivingston Alexander, pro-

‘ vost and vice president for

Academic Affairs at Kean

University in Union, N.]., has

been named president of Pitt-
Bradford, effective Aug. 1.

“I’ve been in higher education

' for over 26 years in a number of

capacities, including facultyand
administrative, and I have taught
both undergraduatesand gradu-

‘ate students,” Alexander told

the University Times last week.
“During_this time, I’ve developed
a passion for undergraduate edu-
cation, because I believe very
strongly in the value of sound
undergraduate programs as a
pathway to successin American
society.” I

Noting Bradford’s commit-

ment to undergraduate educa-
tion excellence, Alexander said
he was thrilled to,be chosen as
the campus’s new president. He
will succeed interim president
William Shields.

“I could sense with the faculty
during the interview process that
there is a deep commitment to
really make a difference in the
lives of students. There is an

atmosphere to keep students

engaged,” he said. I

of northwest and north central
Pennsylvania and south central

At Kean,’ Alexander oversaw
the development of several new
academic programsand a distance
education program. During the
past three years there, he focused

Livingston Alexander, new
Bradford campus president

  

on implementing an innovative.
general education program. “In
our world today, it is important
that, while students might forget
what they learn in their majors,

‘they retain the critically impor-

tant skills learned in general
education courses,” he main-
tained. “At Kean, we found that
for students who are in need of
some remediation, we could link

those efforts with strategically .

designed college—level _course
sin, say, English composition and

college-level algebra,” enabling «

students to develop the skills and
acquire the knowledge associated
with a broad liberal arts and sci-
ences education.

He said that approach, which
includes course-embedded
assessments to monitor achieve-
merit of cognitive and other
skills, coupled with incorporating
more technical components into
courses, increased retention rates
and aided recruitment at Kean.

Whether a similar program
will work at Br,‘adford,.Alexander
is not sure. “I’m not going there
with presumptions,” he said.
“We’ll be focused on the future,

building on the strengths, high-
lighting the needs and deﬁning

the kinds of collaborations that

will enhance our programs.”

Similarly, he has a -w'ait-and-
see attitude about the effect of

recent budget cuts in the cur-

rent ﬁscal year and potential

future ones-, he said. “We’ve had
budget cuts here at Kean, too. I

was surprised by how close—knit

the [Bradford “campus] faculty
and staff appear to be in terms

of general consensus about what

needs to . be done, particularly
what the needs of students are,”
Alexander said. “I was also struck
by the openness of the institution
to talk about the shortcomings
and how to move ahead. I’ll be

going there first to listen, learn

and be responsive to the Bradford

institutional community and how i

it links up with the University
system’s overall direction.”

In addition to being named
UPB president, Alexander was
awarded a tenured position in

Bahnson memorial service set-

Amemorial service for Henry
T. Bahnson, who was credited
with building the Pitt medical
school’s Department of Surgery
into one of the top surgery
departments in the United States,
will be held May 23 at 1 p.m.’in
Heinz Memorial Chapel.

A reception will follow in the
Members.Lounge of the Univer-
sity Club, 123 University Place.

Bahnson was a professor of
surgery and department chair-
man here from 1963 to 1987,
making him the longest—serving
chairman in the Pitt medical
school’s 116-year history. He
was the ﬁrst to hold the George
V. Foster Chair in Surgery. Fol-
lowing his retirement as surgery

chair, Bahnson continued to serve.
on the Pitt medical faculty until
his death on Jan. 10 at age 82,
following complications from a
stroke. - 1

In 1968, Bahnson performed
the ﬁrst heart transplant in Penn-
sylvania. Thirteen years later, he
recruited organ transplantation
pioneer Thomas E. Starzl to Pitt,
a move that helped establish the
University among the world’s
leading transplant centers.

UNIVERSITY SENATE
IVI A T T E R S I Nathan Hershey

The ﬁrst newspaper I read with any regularity
as a youngster growing up in New York in the
1930s and early 40s was PM. It was new, and
unique because it carried no advertising. I was
particularly attracted to it because of its masthead
slogan, “We Are Against People VVho Push Other‘
People Around.” I decided to adopt that state-
ment as a" governing principle for my life. (My
approval of the statement doesn’t mean I haven’t,

on occasion, pushed other people around. )

I did not expect that one role of a University Senate ofﬁcer,
particularly that of president, is to serve as a resource or contact
person for faculty members who believe that they have been
“pushed around” by a person superior to them in the academic
hierarchy and who do not see any avenue for redress readily
available. The University has a grievance policy and procedures
for review of adverse promotion and tenure decisions; however,
many of the alleged improper actions of their superiors do not
fall within the policy’s definition of grievance.

I had been contacted for assistance by a number of faculty
members who felt they were the victims of abusive or arbitrary
actions, beginning long before I became a Senate ofﬁcer. My
business picked up when I became Senate president. A

Nearly all the faculty who have come to me since I became a
Senate officer were Health Sciences faculty, most of them from
the School of Medicine. Their problems were with their division
chief and/or the department chair. They had often ﬁrst sought
some intervention from individuals higher in the school’s structure
but found no relief or support con1ing from the school’s dean or,
in the case of a medical school clinician, the chief executive of
the University of Pittsburgh Physicians (U PP), the professional
practice organization through which medical school clinicians
practice. ‘

, The UPP is a UPMC Health. System subsidiary. A division-
chiefand/or department chair in the medical school ordinarily
holds an equivalent supervisory position with respect to UPMC
clinical services. These dual roles as supervisors can create confu-
sion as to the capacityin which a supervisor is acting. It is possible
that some level of conﬂict is inevitable due to organizational
structure. , ‘ ' »

The UPP has a grievance policy, as does the University. Which

one, ifeither, applies in a particular sit_ua:t_i_on would deprendqong

 

lem. Faculty assert that some mid—level academic administrators
treat faculty members disrespectfullyand act in an arbitrary and
harassing manner. Suchiconduct is the antithesis of leadership.
These administrators lack the personnel skills. necessary for ‘
effective performance. .' ‘ , ‘
More important has been the apparent failure of the higher
level administrator, such as the department chair or dean, to give
‘ serious attention to the complaints that might call for some inter-
vention if it appears that abusive, arbitrary or unfair actions have
taken place. Could the failure be due in part to the higher level
administrator’s belief that one must stand behind the subordinate
administrator 100 percent, in. order to retain the loyalty of that
administrator and other subordinate administrators?
' All employees are expected to work to carry out the organi-
zation’s mission. A senior supervisor, and the organization, can
‘beneﬁt’ by knowing whether a subordinate is performing in an
appropriate fashion, and not abusing the assigned authority.
Some objective assessment of a complaint is «necessary. Action
to ameliorate a problem may not require anything drastic, such as
removal. The problem may only call for cautioning the individual.
to give more thought to the impact of contemplated actions in.
order to avoid conduct or decision-making that would be abusive

supervisor canimprove, then the individual should be replaced,
for the sake of the organization.

It is not clear that the grievance policies of the University
and the UPP work in a way that indicates they yield just results.
I understand the U_PP’s grievance policy has never even been
invoked. That, in itself, may indicate that School of Medicine
faculty clinicians do not believe they could obtain “a fair shake”
in the grievance process. Also, neither grievance policy appears
to deal with the misuse of the evaluation process by immediate
supervisors to retaliate for real or imagined slights.

Perhaps it is time to reevaluate these grievance policies to
learn whether they provide sufficient opportunity for aggrieved
faculty members. Law does not require that an employer main-
tain a grievance policy. The presence of such a policy, properly
employed, can help to create a better work environment, which
beneﬁts both the employer and employees. The University and
the UPP have an interest in knowing whether their policies and
"procedures offer a true opportunity for one to state his/her case
before an objective person or panel. Nationally, litigation by
whistleblowers and employees asserting claims for retaliatory
discharge are on therise. This alone would justify directing atten-
tion to reducing conduct that gives rise to grievances.

Pittsburgh faculty salaries gain
ground in latest AAU rankings

verage salaries of Pitts-
burgh campus assistant
rofessors ($59,600),
associate professors ($68,000)
and full professors ($102,400)
all have gained ground since last
year,compared with salaries at
other Association of American
Universities (AAU) schools.
Pitt now ranks at, or above,
the median among the 34 public
universities in the United States
that belong to the AAU, a group
of prominent North American
research universities that includes
public institutions such as Pitt,
Penn State and the state systems
of California and New York, as
well as Ivy League schools and
other private universities, includ-
ing Carnegie Mellon and the
University of Pennsylvania.

According to the armual salary '

survey published in the March/
April issue of Academe, the jour-
nal of the American Association of
University Professors, Pitt ranks
1_4th among the 34 public AAU
schools for the ‘average salary
paid to assistant professors (up
from 19th place last year); 17th
for associate professors’ average

, salary (up from 2 1 st last year), and

15th for full professors’ average
pay (up from 19th last year).

A Even Pitt librarians’ salaries
— which have long ranked near
the bottom among AAU schools
that belong to the Association of
Research Librarie’s'(ARL)*——=—“have.
“moved up in rank since the 2001-
2002 academic year. ‘

Among the 34 public AAU/
ARL schools, the average salary
of a librarian in Pitt’s University
Library System ($52,000) ranks
26th, up from 30th last year.

Pitt faculty salaries rank con— ‘

siderably lower, proportionately,
when measured against_ salaries

at all 60 private as well as public ‘

AAU universities surveyed.

But Pitt administrators argue
— and University Senate leaders
acknowledge —— that the private
schools’ multi-billion-dollar
endowments, high tuitions, spe-
cialized curricula and freedom
from state government regula-
tion (and reliance on shrink-
ing state appropriations) give
them a nearly_insurmountable
ﬁnancial advantage over public

AAU schools. See table: on pages

4 and 5.

“We have continued tomake
investments in facultysalaries and
we’ve done it consistently, budget
after budget, at a time when
other universities are ﬁnding
themselves hard—pressed to make

those investments,” said Robert F. ’

Pack, vice provost for Academic
Planning and Resources Manage-
ment, at the April 25 meetingof

‘ the’University Senate’s budget
policies committee. '

A number of prestigious

public universities, including the .

University oflllinois and the Uni-
versity of California’s Davis and
Irvine campuses, slipped by 6-10
places in some faculty ranks last
year compared with their AAU
peers, Pack noted._
But he added: “It isn’t just
that we’re benefiting from
‘bad economies in other states.

AAU average salary
charts for assistant, asso-
ciate and full professors,
as well as librarians can be
found on pages 4 and 5.

[Pennsylvania’s] certainly isn’t
any better. But this year’s num-
bers emphasize the high priority
that 'our University has given to
trying to . maintain adequate
increases in compensation.”

The Pittsburgh campus’s
average salary raises this year
were 6.9 percent ‘for full pro-
fessors, 4 percent for associate
professors, 5.3 percent for assis-
tant professors and 7 percent for
librarians.

Among all 34 public AAU
schools, salary raises this year
averaged just 2 percent for pro-
fessors, '2.3 percent for associate
professors, 4.4 percent for assis-
tant professors and 1.8 percent
for librarians.

Pack noted what he called “a
systematic movement of money
during the last seven or eight
years from administrative to
academic areas” at Pitt, a move
endorsed by faculty and staff
participating in Pitt’s 10-year-
old University Planning and
Budgeting System.

When state funding cuts

‘ -"forced “=P»itt’s—'=astra‘tio‘n to

withhold 2 percent from respon-
sibility units’ budgets last year,
budgets for academic activities
largely’ were spared, the vice
provost said. -

This year’s improvement in
the ranking of assistant profes-
sors’ salaries here proves that
Pitt’s strategy of hiring assistant
profs at the AAU median for
their disciplines is paying off,
Pack said.

This policy has been in place
long enough that Pitt associ-
ate professors’ average salaries
likewise are beneﬁting, he said.
“You now have people coming in

at sufﬁciently high assistant pro- ._

fessors’ salaries in key disciplines
that when they get promoted [to
associate professor], their new
salary is also a more appropri-
ate one.” '
Overtaking the remaining
public universities that pay
higher average salaries than

Pitt will be difﬁcult, according.

to Pack. A few of these schools
(UC-Berkeley, UCLA, State
University of New York—Stony
Brook, among them) are located
in high—cost areas where salaries
are bound to remain high. Other

‘ elite public schools (such as the

University of North Carolina at
Chapel Hill, the University of
Virginia and the University of
VV1sconsin) “aren’t likely to give
up the chase” in bidding for top
faculty, Pack said.

CI

Despite improvements in
Pitt rankings in this year’s salary
survey, the pay gap between
public and private AAU schools
remains a worry, said Pack.

“Clearly, it is becoming’

increasingly difficult for public
universities, no matter what their

intellectual and academic stature,
to compete at the highest level for
the most talented faculty,” he said.
Only a handful of public schools
have made the AAU’s top 20 for
salaries in any professorial rank
in recent years. .
“Despite the gesture that
Stanford is making to freeze its

  
 
 
 
 
  
    
  
 
 
 
   
  
  
  
 
 

  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
   
  
 
 

on enrollment growth and the
generation of revenue,” he said.

Prior to becoming Kean’s
provost in 1998, Alexander
served from 1994 to 1998‘ as
vice president for Academic
Affairs at Troy State University
in Montgomery, Ala.

Before joining Troy. State,
he was associate vice president
for Academic Affairs at Western
Kentucky University from 1990

' to 1994, following more than a

decade as a psychology profes-
sor at Western Kentucky. He also
held a faculty position at Georgia
Southern University from 1988
to 1990. * A
Alexander has led seminars
on personal and interpersonal
dimensions of leadership and
diversity for the American
Council on Education’s' fellow-
ship program and has served as

chair of the NewJersey Council -

of Chief Academic Ofﬁcers and
as an elected member of the
American Association of Uni-
versity Adrninistrators Board of
Directors.

Alexander also is an elected
member of the Board of Gover-
nors ofThe Renaissance Group, a
national association of presidents,
provosts and deans focused on
improving teacher education,
and is chair of the College Bound
Advisory Council for the State of
New Jersey, overseeing precol—
lege programs for students from

salaries this year because of the
[sluggish] stock market, we all
know that’s a ploy, that there are
lots of faculty at Stanford who
will probably make more money
next year than they did this year, ”
said Pack. .
“The reality is that a handful
of private schools are absolutely
immune to economic and market
forces,” he said. Even in bad eco-
nomic times, Pack pointed out,
these universities’ endowments
generate more than enough
income to pay operating costs.

Andrew Blair, chair of the

‘Bradford president’s search

committee and vice provost for
Faculty Affairs, told the Univer-
sityTimes that Pitt engaged R.H.
Perry and Associates search coun-
cil to higher education to help in
the national search.

He said the search committee
whittled down from eight candi-
dates identiﬁed by Perry to “a few
we felt really good about, which
we presented to the provost in
unranked order.”

Pitt regional campus presi-
dents report to the provost.

“We were looking for a presi-
dent who would combine the

‘ talents of a CEO with faculty

experience, and especially one
who is committed to undergradu-
ate education,” Blair said.

if not ever,” he said.

“There is some question about
whether the median of the AAU
public: should be our target,”
Wion“noted. “The median of
the overall AAU is our long-
standing goal.

that Pitt’s goal, as enunciated by
the chancellor this year, is to be
one of the great universities of
the world. And the median of
the public AAU institutions in
the United States is not going
to make us one of the best in
the world.

“But this [AAU survey] is real
progress,” Wion allowed, “and I
thinkwe ought to look at the full-
ness of the glass rather than any
emptiness.” ~

UNIVERSITY TIMES

Trustees approve $32 million in  
construction, renovation projects

itt trustees this week

approved four construc-

tion projects totaling
more than $32 million, includ-
ing one of a series of residence
halls to be built on the Pittsburgh
upper campus.

The trustees’ property and
facilities committee — which is
authorized to approve building
projects of more than $1 million
—— gave its okay April 28 to:

° Construction of a 9—story
undergraduate residence hall
with a 420-bed capacity by fall
2004.

At a. cost of $22.1 million,
the new dormitory is part of the
University’s strategy to guarantee
four—year, on—campus housing to
undergraduates who request it,
Pitt iofﬁcials said. Pitt hopes to
build at leastthree more dorms
by 2006 east of the Petersen

Center, on and near the former«
site of the razed Pennsylvania
Hall, to increase Pitt’s overall
on—campus capacity from about
6,000 to 7,000 beds.

The source of the project’s
funding is the auxiliary debt,
according to background mate-
rial provided by the property
and facilities committee. The
$2.4 million estimated annual
operating cost of the 9—story
dorm is expected to be offset by
$2 .5 million annual income from
residents’ room and board fees.

The residence hall will have
two types of accommodations.
Student suites will house four
students in two bedrooms,
with two full bathrooms and a
common living area. Other stu-
dent “hotel rooms” will house
two students in one bedroom
with one bathroom.

The residence hall also will

_ include ’ entry lobbies, laundries

and common lounge areas.

The project still must get City
Council approval. According to
Mary Beth Doheny, deputy city
clerk, City Council’s planning,
zoning and land use committee
recommended that the dormi-
tory project be included on
City Council’s agenda.’ Council
is expected to schedule a public
hearing on the project prior to
voting, Doheny said.

Following City Council’s

approval, the project returns to

the City Planning Commission,
which granted initial approval
on April 8, for review of the
building’s specifications and
construction schedule.

0 Phase I of Posvar Hall reno-
vations. At a cost of $6.16 mil-
lion, using Ofﬁce of the Provost

reserve funding, the University
will renovate several areas in
Posvar Hall, primarily on the
3rd, 4th and 5th ﬂoors.

This summer, work is
expected to be done at the
School of Education and the
Department of Economics.
The education school will be
centralized in contiguous space
on the renovated 5th ﬂoor, and
economics will have contiguous
space on the 4th floor, both ready
for occupancy this fall, according
to Pitt ofﬁcials. ' »

During the fall, areas cur-
rently occupied by education
on the 4th ﬂoor and some areas
occupied by economics on that
ﬂoor will be renovated to house an
expanded area for the University
Center for International Studies
(UCIS). ' » I

The Department of Africana
Studies, currently located on the
3rd floor, will move to renovated
space vacated by UCIS on the 4th
ﬂoor, with expected occupancy by

summer term 2004.

_ The phase I renovation proj-
ect includes relocating partition

ebrating Women and Tech-
nology Fair for more than
100 daughters of Pitt staff
on April 24 in the William
Pitt Union.

The fair. aimed at encourag-
ing girls’ interest in science
and technology, featured 20
informational and interac-
tive exhibits. Girls could
look at the "guts" of a com-
puter, test their typing skills
against their parents’, create
digital pictures and hear a
simulated infant heartbeat.

The technology fair was
sponsored by TechSERVE, a
program of Faith Tech and
Student Volunteer Outreach.
Funding was provided by the
Vira I. Heinz Endowments.

In ﬁscal year 2005, phaseiII
renovations of Posvar Hall will
include expanding the contiguous
area for the Graduate School of
Public and International Affairs
on the 3rd ﬂoor, as well as reno-
vations of classrooms and other
spaces.

According to trustees’ back-
ground material, the Posvar Hall
renovation project will improve
the overall functionality and
ambiance of the building through
improved aesthetics, including
enhanced lighting and noise
abatement, and easier naviga-
tion with more distinctive unit
entrances and a clearer room
numbering scheme.

interior upgrades. Using funding
from auxiliary reserves, Pitt will
spend $2.6 million to complete
the renovation of Litchﬁeld
Towers rooms, corridors and
bathrooms that began last year
in Tower B. The project consists
of interior upgrades, including

painting and replacing" light ﬁx-

tures, carpeting, bulletin boards,
shelves andtoilet partitions.

dormitory constructed in 1969
that houses 160 students, Hick-
ory Hall will undergo interior
renovations, in ﬁscal years 2004
and 2005.-Renovations include
upgrading building systems, ﬁx-
tures, hardware and ﬁnishes, as
well as the installation of a new
sprinkler system and replacement
of all furnishings. '
The cost is $1.73 million, with
the Johnstown Campus auxiliary
debt as the source of funding.

4 Hearing held a

on beneﬁts case

Having presented oral argu-
ments April 23 in the lawsuit
seeking to force Pitt to extend

' health beneﬁts to its employees’

same—sex partners, attorneys are
waiting for Allegheny County
Common Pleas Court Judge
Robert Gallo to rule on the
University’s request for a per-
manent injunction in the case.

Pitt has asked Gallo to per-
manently bar the city’s Human’
Rights Commission from hearing
a discrimination case against the
University by seven current and
former employees. Plaintiffs say
Pitt violates Pittsburgh’s anti-
discrimination ordinance by
denying health beneﬁts for their
same—sex partners.

Pitt attorneys deny that

charge, saying the ordinance does,
not require employers to offer A

such beneﬁts. They also claim
the city ordinance is superseded
by a 1999 state law that exempts
Pennsylvania’s state-related
universities from municipal
ordinances requiring them to

provide health beneﬁts.
Whichever side Gallo rules _
against could ask the judge to V

reconsider his opinion, or appeal

the case to Commonwealth

Court. ,

attorney for the ACLU repre-

that if faculty give examinations
and impose tougher standards,
students will go elsewhere, which
I believe is nonsense.”

° A growing trend among the

I department’s doctoral students to

pursue narrow research interests
and take only those courses
required for completing their
dissertations. _

“The ethos among these stu-
dents is very different from what
it was during what is often called
the department’s golden age [of
the 1960s and 70s],” Griinbaum
said. “They tend to prefer courses
where a professor just lectures
at them like a guru. They avoid
courses likemine, and those, of

A some other faculty members, that

employ the Socratic method.

“I mean, Socrates was not
some bum off the streets of
Athens!” Griinbaum said, with
a laugh. “But too many gradu-
ate students in the philosophy
department are afraid that if
they are shown to have made a
mistake duringa question—and—
answer discussion, they will be

embarrassed in front of their

fellow students.”
3 .
In an April 24 letter to Grun-
baum, philosophy chairperson
Stephen Engstrom wrote that

. the department reacted to news.

of Griinbaum’s resignation with
“great sadness and regret.”

“I want to emphasize that
in saying this I am not speak-
ing just for myself or for a few
of my colleagues,” Engstrom

with the causes of my escalat-
ing alienation from it before I
reached the breaking point.”

Griinbaum said he had come
close to resigning in 1999. But the
philosophy department’s incom-
ing chairperson ‘at that time,
Tamara Horowitz (“who shared
my strong aversion to some of
the departmental modus opermzdz,”
Griinbaum wrote) pledged to
reform the department and con-
vinced him to remain, according
to Griinbaum.

Then, in_ January 2000,
Horowitz, 49, died of complica-

tions from a brain tumor.

More recently, Griinbaum
said, he postponed his resignation
until the end of the spring term
to avoid “undue embarrassment”
over the philosophy depart:rnent’s
co-sponsorship of “Adolffest, ” an
April 12 event celebrating his
80th birthday (which actually
occurs on May 15).

Philosophy » chairperson
Engstrom noted that some of
Gr1'inbaum’s criticisms dove-
tailed with those expressed by
philosophy graduate students
in their Jan. 22 open letter to
faculty. (In a secret ballot, 43
graduate students afﬁrmed that
they agreed with the letter. Five
abstained, and none disagreed.)

This winter, an ad hoc com-

mittee of philosophy faculty and

' graduate students began meeting

to discuss concerns about class
sizes, students’ funding, and.the
length of time ittakes to complete

gns from philosophy dept.

 

Adolf Grunbaum

which faculty write few com-
ments. “And often the comments
are returned to us months, semes-
ters or even years later -— long
after they have ceased to be useful
to us,” students wrote.

In a Feb. 20 letter of reply,
philosophy faculty thanked
students for their “construc-
tive and thoughtful expression
of concerns,” pointing out that
certain complex issues such as
funding and the time it takes to
complete the Ph.D. program will
be addressed by the department’s
ad hoc committee.

In the meantime, faculty
encouraged grad students “to
make appointments with us to
discuss your work, or simply

to drop by and ask us whether

us regard your alienation from
the department in recent years
as one of the most unfortunate
developments in its history. And
speaking for myself, I am disap-
pointed that I was not able to do

« more to counteract it.”

Griinbaum called Engstrom’s
letter “gracious and touching”
and absolved Engstrom (who
has chaired philosophy for only
the last three years) of blame for
the department’s ills.

In an April 18 letter informing
philosophy faculty of his resig-
nation, Griinbaum had written:
“Steve Engstrom has been the
only- chair of the ‘department
who tried to deal systematically

depart'ment’s “ofﬁcial literature’
describes it as a ﬁve-year pro-
gram, it takes more than eight

years to complete a philosophy .

Ph.D. here, students wrote.
Students also complained that

A philosophy’s graduate program is _

not conducive to regular interac-
tion between students and faculty
philosophers, either in class or in
private. “As things stand here,”

they wrote, “one spends many‘

years laboring with little sense

we have some free time to talk
philosophy. This is not asking a
favor. It is an essential aspect of

our contribution to the gradu-

  

ate program, and you should take
advantage of it.”

Faculty pledged to return
term papers (with substantial
comments) within one month.

Engstrom said: “We certainly
take the students’ concerns quite
seriously. Our ad hoc committee
will continue to meet in the fall,
and likely will present some rec-
ommendations to the department
for modiﬁcations of the graduate
program.”

Provost James V. Maher
expressed disappointment -at
Griinbaum’s resignation, but

also conﬁdence in the philoso-

phy department.“It’s a very good
department and I’m conﬁdent
they will give serious consider-
ation tomaking improvements,”
said Maher, who is a fellow of
the Center for Philosophy of
Science.
CI

Griinbaum said he feels “both
physically and mentally ﬁt,” and
plans to continue working in
the HPS department and the
Center for Philosophy of Science
for years to come. “In striking

contrastto the Department of '

Philosophy, I ﬁnd the ambience
in the HPS department as well as
in the Center exhilarating, and I
take enormous satisfaction from
feelingvery much at home in both
of them,” he wrote.

Could :Griinbaum’s resigna-
tion simply be a case of a pam-

pered senior scholar quitting

because he felt Pitt administra-
tors were not stroking his ego

sufﬁciently?

Griinbaum laughed off.

that scenario. He said Provost
Maher (to whom Griinbaum,
as a Mellon Professor, reports),
arts and sciences Dean N. John
Cooper and philosophy chair-
person Engstrom “all have been
nothing short ofwonderful to me.
And I have the highest opinion
of them” —— in contrast to
Gr1'inbaum’s opinions of former
arts and sciences Dean Peter
Koehler and former philosophy
chair Rudolph Weingartner, with
whom he feuded bitterly.
“We’re talking about a
Department of Philosophy
that I raised out of the dust to
national eminence,” Griinbaum

said. “Believe me, Iwas not going -

to just terminate my membership
in it because of some minor irri-
tation or annoyance. This was a
well-considered step.”

For decades, Pitt’s philosophy
department has beenrated among
the top ﬁve nationally by various
ranking organizations. But Grun-
baum attributes this largely to a
tendency among outside evalu-
ators to view Pitt’s philosophy
department, HPS department
and Center for Philosophy of
Science as constituting a single,
high-powered entity.

As for the Pitt philosophy
department’s continuing high
status, Griinbaum commented,
acidly: “Once you have the
reputation as being an early riser,
you can sleep until noon for many
years before people realize you’re
no longer getting up early.” —

The 350 service employees,

which include cleaners, mainte-

and pool operators, are members

— of Division 29 of the Service
Employees International Union A

(SEIU), AFL—CIO. The SEIU
workers have been negotiating
with Pitt since their three—year
contract expired Dec. 31.

In a follow-up letter to the
most recent bargaining session
on April 15, Pitt increased its
salary offer from 1.25 percent
to 1.75" percent, according to
John Greeno, Human Resources
assistant vice chancellor for
employee/labor relations, who
is Pitt’s chief negotiator. The
University also is offering the
same new health care beneﬁts
options offered to faculty and
non-unionized staff, he said.

But according to_ Tom Hoff-
man, deputy trustee of the local
SEIU chapter,’ the health’ care
beneﬁts options are inadequate.

“The health care plan is
totally unacceptable,” Hofﬁnan
said. Beneﬁts costs wi_ll price
many‘ workers out of the health
care plan options, he said. “We
cannot afford to pay for this plan

and still provide for our families,” '

Hoffman maintained.

The next bargaining session
is set for May 15. ' '

In July 2000, following six
months of negotiations, the
union and Pitt agreed to a

Presentation on research university planning.-
underslanding and analysis

Maher stated that higher education has been
under terrific strain in the past 10 years, with almost
every institution having financial difficulties. He
added that, in spite of difficulties in the early 1990s,
the University is now one of the few colleges and
universities that is solid financia"y. In discussing
the future of higher education, Maher emphasized
the need for institutions to address their many

different missions. In the early 1990s, the University _

shortened its lengthy mission statement to a single
page stressing research. graduate education and
undergraduate education. At the same time, the
University improved it§ understanding of marketing
to its output markets (employers. graduates), input

‘ enrollments, degree production,
‘characteristics, acceptance rates, retention and /
graduation rates. research expenditures and outcomes.

markets (families, government), and intenial markets
(students, faculty. staff).

Since 1994, the University has gradually
addressed a few key initiatives each year. In doing
so. the University has caught up to and surpassed
many institutions of higher education in dealing
with essential planning and budgeting issues. Maher
stated that the University is now very analytical about

every program itoffers, matching faculty strengths in .

research withcurricula that draw upon those strengths.
As a result, student applications have risen both in
number and in quality- Faculty recruitment _has
improved as well.

Maherdiscussed the unique elements of the cost
structure of research universities compared to other
institutions of higher education. He indicated that
the University planning and budgeting efforts in the
past seven years have been driven by the recognition
that the country can support a limited number of
research universities in the coming century. Among
these activities have been:

—- Facilities planning, now in the sixth year
of a 10-year plan that the University has closely
followed; V

— lnfonnation structure planning, now in

' its third year of fixing many previously existing

problems;

— Campus environment planning, which has
resulte_d in signiﬁcant changes in culture due in large
part to the activities of the enrollment management
committee;

— Annual academic planning, which has
closely tied school plans to the annual budgets of
the schools; . i

—The capital campaign, which has strengthened
the University endowment; and ,

— lmprovedcommuiiications, from committees.
to employee training opportunities, to. publications
like the Campaign Chronicle.

Maher indicated that more improvements
are needed, particularly given the state of the
commonwealth budget and its impact on tuition
rates. He cited an analysis by Pennsylvania State
University, which preceded the FY 2003 and FY 2004
reductions in commonwealth appropriation and yet
concluded that Penn State needed its in-state tuition
level to reach $1 1,000 to ensure stable delivery of the
quality expected of a major research university. Even
though this is high by state university standards. it is
dramatically less than high-quality private schools

set as tuition for a comparable education.

Maher presented an analysis of the University
relative to various peer institutions. Among
the benchmarks analyzed were data regarding
freshman

state appropriations. annual giving and class sizes.

The bottom line is that the University must keep .

improving, addressing issues such as academic and
student life initiatives, the research development
fund. and especially salaries.

Update on the medical insurance contract

Cochran reported that with insurance plan
modiﬁcations, moving to u fully-insured pmgnnn. and
setting a target of 85% einployerll5'X.- employee cost
sharing, the incremental University budget obligation
related to the new medical insunince contract is $9.5
Inillion. Vlfith the exception of some minor modiﬁcations,
Cochran reported that this contract represents the best‘
that could be expected given the current health care
enviroiunent

Cochran also discussed the issue of medical
insurmice coverage for retired faculty. In the past, the
University covered expenses beyond Medicare and, as
time passed, costs have increased drmnutically and will
do so again in the coming year. Cochnni reported that
a human resources consultant found that only 23% of
employers nationally provide a retiree insurance plzui
and. of that number, only 24% of the employers pay a
portion of the costs. The consultant also found that this
proportion is decrezniing. Cochran added thatthe University
has no service requirement for eligibility to the progruin.
which is unique. He suggested that a cap be placed on
the University s duwnstreain liability and that a service

requireineni of some sort (perhaps a fomiula combining
age and years of service) be imposed. I

Cochran ‘indicated that the ﬁnal work on the
parameters related to the University medical insunince
plan should be finalized by mid—April. He added that
the University is making every eﬁon to treat regional
campus employees equitably. Cochran asked faculty
and staff leaders to ameliorate concerns over premium
increases, especially given that the University has not
increased premiums in ﬁve years. ‘

Banks moved that the corrunittee suppon the 19

proposed target distribution of premium allocations of
85% university/15% employee. Mowery seconded. The

motion passed unanimously.

Update on F Y 2004
planning and budgeting parameters

Ramicone reported on the current status of
discussions by the parameters subcommittee. These
discussions are in their early stages, and the focus is on
refining cost estimates and developing scenarios for
revenue estimates. The primary variables at this time
include the increases in tuition rates and employee
compensation. The focus is on ensuring that the
parameters provide for the continued improvement
in the University. —

; itt’s Class of 2003 —— the
first to hold gradua-
' tion ceremonies at the
Petersen Events Center -- heard
a short list of “universal truths
that may be worth sharing” from
speaker Paul H. O’Neill, former
U.S. Secretary of the Treasury
and former president and CEO
of Alcoa.

In a commencement address
striking for its brevity, titled
“New Directions: The Oppor-
tunity Ahead,” O’Neill talked
about unrealized humani'poten-
tial and the value of leadership in
developing it. i V

‘.‘I believe, and I think'I could
demonstrate it to you, that

 

human beings everywhere have

the potential to succeed greatly
—— every humanbeing,” O’Neill
told the new Pitt degree-earners
April 27.

His world travels have con-
vinced himthatsocietyneeds “to
move with much greater speed
than we haveimoved so far as a
world civilization in achieving
what we know is possible for
every human being,” he said.

“To put us in; the context of

where we are today, we can win V

war with munitions but wecan
only win the peace with ideas,”
he said. No matter where gradu-
ates choose to live and work,
“You’re now empowered, as a
consequence of the investment
you’ve made, with ideas and a
capacity to learn, and I hope -you
also feel an obligation to make a
difference.” V 2 .

chapterin his life, our honored
speaker took one“ of those clas-
sic Pittsburgh industries, the

Treasury. - _
“He hasxstood beside the
weak and made them stronger,

-and stood among the privileged _‘

and made them more aware of

berg said of O’Neill. V

One of the pleasures of being
Pitt’s chancellor, Norden-berg

jsaid,is having “the opportunity
to bestow the highest honor on 5
an individual who embodies”,
the things that the University‘

stands for: intellectualcuriosity,

S. Dietrich II, who said‘ O’Neill
demonstrated straight-forward
leadership that has helped to
better people’s lives. “Your
innovation, ambition, passion
for social justice and ability to
inspire others to embrace your
noble vision  is combined with
a practical sense of what it means

to do the right thing,” Dietrich

Citing O’Neill’s role as
defender of workers’ safety at
Alcoa, and his commitment to
meeting health care needs both in
this country and abroad, Dietrich
said, “Your life’s work has brought
honor to thetask and mission of
leadership to our nation’s busi-
ness sector, its government and
to the city of Pittsburgh.”

In his address, O’Neill said,
“On the ‘off-chance that you will

remember something beyond the

sunny day, let me tell you things
that are meaningful to me. I
believe with leadership every-
thing is possible. And without
leadership nothing is possible.”

He said a leader needs to pro-
vide a stable system that promotes
certainty, and have a daring vision
of what could be.

O’Neill, who this March was
appointed a University director
of the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center (UPMC) and a
member of the executive com-
mittee of the UPMC board,
lambasted a health care system
where “one in every 14 people in
the United States who goes into
an acute medical facility gets an
infection they didn’t bring with
them.” A

RESEARCH NOTES

IVIen tvvice as
likely to die
during storms

Men are more than twice as
likelyto die duringthunderstorms
than are women, and most cases
involve a vehicle or sports.’

These ﬁndings from a Pitt
study were presented April 28 at
the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention’s Safety in Num-
bers meeting in Atlanta.

“We found that deaths from
thunderstorm-related weather
conditions center around ﬂash
ﬂoods and lightning strikes, and
the victims are primarily male,”

said Thomas J. Songer, assis- -

tant professor of epidemiology at
Pitt’s Graduate School of Public
Health and assistant professor
of neurological surgery at Pitt’s
School of Medicine and Center
for Injury Research and Control.
“In deaths from ﬂash ﬂoods and
high winds, most of the victims
were in a vehicle, usually engaged
in an attempt to drive through the
water. VV1th regard to lightning
strikes, most of the victims were
involved in sports or recreational
activities, or in work-related
activities at the time of death.”
Songer examined data on

thunderstorm-related deaths in V

the United States from 1994
through 2000. Speciﬁc weather
elements included thunderstorm
winds, ﬂash ﬂoods, tornadoes
and lightning. Data included
circumstances of death, age,
gender, activity, location, work

relatedness, date, time and

vehicle involvement.

A total of 1,442 deaths were
identiﬁed; 70 percent were males.
Two-thirds occurred outside the
home, and most of these occurred
in males during ﬂash ﬂoods or
lig_htning strikes.

Specifically, the highest
percentage of deaths from ﬂash
ﬂoods involved drivingl transport
(65 percent); from lightning
involved sports/recreation (36
percent) or work (21.8 percent);
from tornadoes involved out-
door activities (40 percent) or
driving/transport (23 percent),
and from high winds involved
driving/transport (35.6 percent)
or boating/ ﬁshing (23 percent).

“When a thunderstorm
strikes, the best thing to do is
to get into a building. But when
that’s not possible, questions arise
over whether to seek low or high
ground; to remain in a vehicle or
to get out,” said Songer. “Judging
by the numbers of deaths from
various weather conditions asso-
ciated with thunderstorms, the
proper course of action appears
to depend upon what weather
conditions one is facing, and
where one is at the time. Light-
ning seeks the highest point in an
area, which puts sports and rec-
reation enthusiasts at risk during
activities that involve a wide-open
playing ﬁeld, golf course or lake.
Getting into a car is advisable,

if possible. On the other hand, .

when near a rising body of water
one should abandon one’s vehicle
and seek higher ground to avoid
ﬂash ﬂoods.” ‘

diabetes, according to study
results published by Pitt Gradu-
ate School of Public‘Health
(GSPH) researchers in the May
2003 issue of Diabetes Care, a

journal of the American Diabetes J

Association. _

“Heart disease is a major
complication for people with
diabetes, including those with
type 1 diabetes, and until now
there has been no clear explana-
tion for its cause,” said principal
investigator Trevor Orchard,
professor in GSPH’s epidemi-
ology department. “We now

suspect that insulin resistance

occurs in those with type 1 dia-
betes in the same way as it does
in those with type 2, essentially
giving these individuals double
diabetes and greatly increasing.
their risk of heart disease.”
Insulin resistance, long associ-
atedwith type 2 diabetes and a risk
factor for heart disease, occurs
when the body does not properly
use insulin to metabolize blood
glucose, or sugar. The condiﬁon
results when insulin fails to enable
cells to admit glucose, necessary
for cells’ energy production.

Glucose then builds up in the

blood, and additional insulin is
required. The new study suggests
that this condition can occur in
people who have type 1 diabetes
as well. .

“The good news is that not all
people with type 1 diabetes are
insulin resistant, and for them the
risk of heart diseasemay not be
as high,” Orchard said. “Clearly,
reducing or preventing insulin

tion may help people with type 1 A

(PEDCS), a 10-year prospec-
tive investigation based on a
cohort of adults with type 1, or
childhood—onset, diabetes. Of the
658 subjects in PEDCS, 603 did
not have heart disease at baseline
and were followed for the cur-
rent study.

Over the 10-year period there
were 108 cardiovascular events
such as angina, heart attack or
death among the participants.
Risk factors were lowest among
those who experienced no cardio-
vascular events, moderate among
those with angina and highest
among those whodied.

Insulin resistance was a risk

. factor that predicted all adverse

events, and it was the most severe

_among those participants who

experienced the most serious
events. A

To measure insulin resistance,
investigators used the estimated
glucose disposal rate (eGDR), a
novel calculation based on waist-
to—hip ratio, hypertension status
and long-term blood sugar levels.
Study participants with no car-
diovascular events had a normal
eGDR; those who experienced
angina, considered a moderate
event, had a lower eGDR; and
those with the most severe events
had the lowest eGDR.

High blood sugar itself was
the only potential risk factor
that did not appear to predic

cardiovascular events. a

“Our analyses are consistent
with ‘the hypothesis that indi-
viduals with high blood glucose
develop plaques in their coronary
arteries that are more ﬁbrous than

normal. That quality could have
‘a stabilizing effect that makesthe

plaque less likely to rupture and
cause a blood clot that would
result in a heart attack,” Orchard

explained. “However, any pro-

tective effect from the ﬁbrous
nature of their arterial plaque is
countered by the likelihood that
glucose causes more such plaques
and that it will not affect the risk
of atherosclerosis-related prob-
lems elsewhere in the body, where
the very existence of plaque can
lead to lower extremity arterial
disease, which sometimes results
in amputation.”

The study. was supported
by the National Institutes of
Health. ‘ '

Bacteriophages ,

may be Iar est
unexplore
reservoir of

data

The largest unexplored
reservoir of gene sequence
information may be contained

in bacteriophages, viruses that

infect bacteria, according to a
paper published in the April 18
edition of Cell.

Contributing to the paper
were researchers at Pitt, Albert
Einstein College ofMedicine, the
Tuberculosis Research Center of

India, and two American high

schools.

Characterizing the genomes
of 10 new mycobacteriophages
for the study revealed an astound-
ingnumber ofnever-before—seen
genes, according to principal
investigators Graham Hatfull,
Roger Hendrix and Jeffrey
Lawrence of Pitt’s biological
sciences department and Wil-
liam R. Jacobs Jr., professor of
microbiology and immunology
and of molecular genetics and
a Howard Hughes Medical
Institute (HHMI) investigator
at Einstein College. Hatfull is
an HHMI Professor and Eberly
Family Professor of Biotechnol-
ogy, Hendrix is a professor of bio-
logical sciences and Lawrence is
an associate professor. ,

s The researchers found that 50
percent of the genes in the myco-
bacteriophages they studied had
never been seen previously and
that 80 percent of the remaining
50 percent had been found only

' on the 14 mycobacteriophages

that have been sequenced to
‘date. .
Bacteriophages are the most

abundant organisms on Earth,

with estimates of the number

of different species at 10 million

trillion ‘trillion. N o genornically
deﬁned phage has been isolated
more than once, and the few
sequenced phage genomes are
widely‘ varied, according to the
paper’s authors.

“The genomic sequences of
these newly isolated mycobacte-
riophages suggest that the bacte-
riophage population as a whole is
amazingly diverse,” said Hatfull.
“There is some suggestion that
phages could be involved in
bacterial pathogenesis in ways
we never imagined.” "

For example, one of the
phages studied _contained a gene
homologous to the‘ human gene
in lupus, according to Jacobs.
“While we don’t yet know the
function of this protein, we’re
pretty conﬁdent that itwill lead us
to better understanding of lupus.
Many autoimmune diseases have

infectious origins —-,— lupus may

also.”

The researchers conducted
their work with the aid, of high
school students from Pelham
Memorial High School in
Pelham, N.Y., and Greater
Latrobe High School in Latrobe,
Pa. Participating students, who
are listed as coauthors’ of the

paper, were part of a ‘science

educational program established

, by the Howard Hughes Medi-

cal Institute. In the project, the
high school students gathered
samples, participated in puriﬁca-
tion of the phages and isolation of
DNA, and assisted in the electron
microscopy.

Gene therapy
may‘ treat
post-radical
prostatectomy

‘ erectile

clysfu n ction
. Researchers from the Univer-

sity of Pittsburgh Medical Center

. (UPMC) have found that gene

therapymaynot only be a feasible,
but also may be an ideal treat-
ment for neuropathic erectile
dysfunction (ED). Neuropathic
ED results from damage to the
nerves essential to achieving and
maintaining an erection and is
experienced by 79.6 percent of
men who undergo radical pros-
tatectomies. . ‘ “
‘‘VVhile radical prostatec-

tomy can be a cure for early
stage prostate cancer in a large
percentage of patients, there are
a number of risks and side effects
that patients must consider when
deciding on whether to have the
surgery or not —— one of those

being the high likelihood of’

experiencing ere’cti‘1e-=‘r"el§is‘fiir1c: '

tion,” said lVIichae1 Chancel-
lor, director of neurourology at
UPMC and professor of urology

at Pitt’s School of Medicine. “If .

by using gene therapy prior to
surgery, we can minimize nerve
damage and preserve the patient’s
ability to have an erection, the
patient may be less reluctant to
have the potentially life—saving
procedure.”

In the study, researchers
injected herpes simplex virus

' vectors that deliver neurotrophic

factors, factors that facilitate the
recovery of injured nerves, into
the corpus cavernosum or cav-
ernous nerve of rats at the time

'_ of cryo-injury to the cavernous

nerve. The cavernous nerve is
the nerve that stimulates erec-
tion; cryo-injury has similar
effects on the nerve as radical
prostatectomy. After injection,
they found that the viral vectors
transported the neurotrophic fac-

tors to the nerve. On electrical ‘

nerve stimulation, nerve-injured
rats that expressed theviral vector
experienced an increase in intra-
cavernous pressure. . .

. Researchers hope that this
concept’ can be translated into
humans, enabling» gene" therapy
to be used as a prophylactic treat-
ment for men undergoing radical
prostatectomy.

Radical’ prostatectomy is
used to treat the early stages
of prostate cancer by surgically
removing the prostate gland and
surrounding tissue. The proce-
dure has a success rate of 70 to
85 percent. A high percentage of
patients experience ED after the
procedure due to injury, to- the
peripheral nerves, including the
cavernous nerve, located close to

_ the prostate gland.

Study results were presented
April 28 at the annual meeting of
theAmerican Urological Associa-
tion (AUA) and are published in
abstract 1179 of the AUA pro-
ceedings.

In addition to studying the
use of gene therapy to treat
post-radical prostatectomy ED,
the Pitt team also is investigat-
ing the potential of using muscle
derived stem cells to regenerate
peripheral nerves often damaged
by radical prostatectomy. This
study is published in abstract
1256 of the AUA proceedings.

LGBP resolves
or improves
diabetes for
most patients ~
Accordingto a studypresented
April 24 by University of Pitts-
burgh Medical Center (U PMC)
researchers at the American
Surgical Association’s (ASA)
annual meeting in Washington,
D.C., 97 percent of patients who
underwent laparoscopic Roux-
en Y gastric bypass surgery for
obesity (LGBP) had resolution
or improvement of their type 2
diabetes mellitus. A
The study by Philip Schauer,

assistant professor of medicine

at Pitt’s School of Medicine and

co-director of the Minimally
Invasive Surgery Center at
UPMC Presbyterian, examined
1,150 patients over a ﬁve—year
period following their LGBP
surgeries. Of those patients in

type 2 diabetes mellitus and 192
of the 240 patients (80 percent)
were available for follow—up.
The LGBP procedure
involves constructing a small
stomach pouch of approximately
1 5 millimeters (about the size of a’
plastic medicine cup), and bypass-

ing a small segment of intestines

by constructing a Y—shaped limb
of small bowel. Patients lose
weight because there is a decrease

. in caloric intake resulting from

the reduced reservoir capacity of
the small stomach pouch.

produces. About 80 ercent of
people with type 2 diabetes are

“Patients with the shortest
duration and mildest form of dia-
betes prior to surgery had quicker
resolution and signiﬁcantly better
outcomes, suggesting that early
surgical intervention is warranted
to increase the likelihood of
patients having a normal level

Schauer.‘ 3

llllininlally

 invasive

esophagus
surgery results
in improved
survival, less
hospital time

, Findings from the largest

. study to date evaluating rnini—

mally invasive esophagectomy
(removal of the esophagus to treat
esophageal cancer) indicate that
the procedure results in lower
mortality rates and shorter hos-
pital stays compared with most
open procedures.

The results of the study, con‘-
ducted by James D. Luketich,
associate professor of surgery
and chief, Division of Thoracic

Surgery, University of Pittsburgh

Medical Center (UPMC) and co— '

director, Lung and Esophageal
Cancer Program, University
of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute,
and Chrish Fernando, also of

UPMC, were, presented. at. the .

annual meeting of the American
Surgical Association‘(ASA), April
24-26, in Washington, D.C.
Minimally invasive esopha-
gectomy, or MIE, was evaluated
in 221 patients at UPMC from

June 1996 through August 2002. s
Average hospital stays and mor- .
itality rates were compared with

MIE compared with typical hos-
pital stays in excess of 10 days
for patientswho underwent open
procedures. The study also found
that mortality occurred in 1.3
percent of the MIE cases com-
pared with typical mortality rates
of up to 5 percent or higher as
reported for open procedures.

MIE is a video—assisted
surgical procedure that utilizes
instruments introduced into the
body through very small inci-
sions and a laparoscope, or tiny
camera. Patients who are candi-
dates for MIE undergo extensive
preoperative evaluation involving
laparoscopic staging, endoscopic
ultrasound and CT scans to assess
the extent of the disease.

“Our study demonstrates that
minimally invasive esophagec-
tomy offers results as good as, if
not better than, open esophageal
procedures,” said Luketich, who
also is co-director of the Mark
Ravitch/LeonC. Hirsch Center
for Nlinimally Invasive Surgery
at UPMC. “These results are

encouraging and demonstrate

that MIE can improve patient

outcomeswithoutcomprornising q

accepted standards of care.”
Luketich stressed, however,
that the success of esophagec-
tomy, whether done through
standard open approaches or
minimally invasively ones, largely

depends on surgical expertise in
the procedure and volume of pro-
cedures performed annually. He
also noted that excellent results
using open approaches have been
reported from centers that spe-
cialize in esophagectomy.

The American Cancer Society
estimates that in 2003 approxi-
mately 1 3,900 people will develop
esophageal cancer in the United
States, and 13,000 will die from
the disease. It also has been noted
that esophageal cancer is rapidly

rising in the United States.

The only known risk factor
for esophageal cancer is chronic
heartburn. Esophageal cancer
can develop in any part of the
esophagus and often spreads to
the windpipe, large blood vessels
in the chest, lungs, liver and stom-
ach.‘Symptoms include difﬁculty
swallowing, weight loss, loss of
appetite, coughing, hoarseness,
bone pain and shortness of
breath.

Co-authors for the study, in
addition to Fernando, included
Miguel Alvelo-Rivera, Philip
Schauer, Percival O. Buc-
naventura, Neil A. Christie
and James McCaughan, all
with Pitt. 1 ’

Ornburghs   law lecture Series 9 Winter Jazz 1-aisgs funds at 

Dick and GinnyThornburgh,
who recently received the Henry
B. Betts Award from the American
Association of People with Dis-
abilities (AAPD), have donated
the $50,000 Betts Award funds
to Pitt to establish the Thorn-
burgh Family Lecture Series in
Disability Law and Policy.

The lecture series will be
administered through Pitt’s
School of Law ‘and School of
Health and Rehabilitation Sci-
ences (SHRS), in conjunction
with the DickThornburgh Archi-
val Collection in Pitt’s University
Library System. Pitt’s law school
and SHRS created a disabilities
law concentration for the master
of studies in law (MSL) degree,
the first such degree program in
the nation.

A former governor of Penn-
sylvania and attorney general of
the United States, Dick Thom-
burgh is a 1957 graduate of the
University’s law school.

While attorney general,
Thornburgh played a major
role in the 1990 enactment of the
Americans with Disabilities Act.
A recipient of the George Bush
Medal in 2001 for his service to
people with disabilities, Thorn-
burgh is a founding member of
the National Organization on
Disability (NOD) and serves as
vice—chair of the World Commit-
tee on Disability. ‘ 9

Ginny Thornburgh is direc-
tor of the Religion and Disability‘
Program of NOD, and for more
than 13 years she has focused on
making congregations and semi-
naries more welcoming to people
with disabilities.

As described by the Thorn-
burghs, the lectureship will
address high-proﬁle aspects of
disability , law and policy and

seek to attract speakers of national
prominence.

“This is just one more example
of Dick and Ginny Thomburgh’s
far—reaching generosity to the
University of Pittsburgh,” said
Pitt Chancellor Mark A. Nor-
denberg. “Two key examples

are Dick’s service as a trustee:

and their donation of the Dick
Thornburgh Archival Collection
to our Library System.

“Now, with theicreavtion of
the Thornburgh Family Lec-
ture Series in Disability Law
and Policy, they have given
the University an important
opportunity to build upon its
academic strengths within the

School of Law and the School
of Health and Rehabilitation Sci-
ences — strengths which have, at
their core, a mission of advocacy
for those with disabilities.”

AAPD is a national mem-
bership organization dedicated
to promoting the economic and
political empowerment of all
people living with disabilities in
the United States.

The organization adminis-
ters the Henry B. Betts Award,

created in 1989 by the Prince ,

bilitation Institute of Chicago. It
is named in honor of Henry B.

“We have enough science and

This is not only theoretically pos-
sible but is practically possible,
and we’re going to do it here in
Pittsburgh with 42 hospitals to
demonstrate to the rest of the
world this concept that we can
reduce the cost of health and
medical care in this country by
50 percent and simultaneously
improve the outcomes,” he said
to loud audience applause.

zation, O’Neill continued, is

Donald Ulin, assistant
professor of

the Bradford
campus, has
received this
year’s Faculty
Te a c h i n g
Award.

U l i n ,
who has
been teach-
ing at Pitt—Bradford since 1998,
received the award during the
annual honors convocation in
April.

“Don is a very demanding
instructor,” said Michael Stuck-
art, interim vice president and
dean of academic affairs. “Since
he has been directing the English
program, we have seen an impres-
sive growth in the program. He
has also contributed a great deal
to our English curriculum by
adding several new courses.”

Ulin was chosen by a selec-
tion committee comprised of two
facultymembers, two department
chairs and one student represen-
tative. The committee reviewed
letters of recommendation,
student evaluations of teaching,
syllabi _and grade distribution.
The committee also considered
teachers’ knowledge of subject
matter and their advising and
dedication in working with
students beyond the classroom

 

’ in such activities as internships

and research projects.

The award, which is in its »

second year, is open to any
full-time faculty member who

‘ has taught at Pitt-Bradford for

English at '

at least the last three academic
ears. I I
“Pitt-Bradford cares a lot
about the quality of its educa-
tion,” Ulin said, “and there are
a lot of excellent teachers here.
So it is extremely gratifying to
be given an award for my own
teaching.” o
Before coming to Pitt—Brad-
ford, Ulin was associate instructor
at Indiana University in Bloom-
ington. He also did research
and wrote for an internationally
syndicated science radio program
in Bloomington.

Katherine M. Detre has
been named distinguished
professor of epidemiology in
the Graduate School of Public
Health (GSPH).

Renowned for her research in
coronary artery disease and her
evaluationof therapies and epi-
demiological methods, Detre has
been at GSPH since 1974, when
she arrived as an associate profes-
sor of epidemiology. She became
a professor in‘1979, and in 1980
she founded the school’s Epide-
miology Data Center, which she
still directs.

One of her main research
interests is the treatment of
patients who have heart disease
as well as diabetes. In 2000, she
began an international study

comparing the effectiveness of

various therapies for individuals
with these two conditions.

. She received her medical
degree from Queen’s University
in Ontario and her doctor of
public health degree from Yale

— University.

I MerrilyK. Swoboda, associ-
ate professor of communication
at the Johnstown campus, has
been selected to receive the
2002-2003 President’s Award
for Excellence in Teaching.

The award will be presented
at the May 3 UP] commencement
ceremony. I

In announcing the award,‘

Johnstown campus President
Albert L. Etheridge said, “Dr.
Swoboda routinely seeks oppor-
tunities to provide meaningful
experiences for her students

beyond the classroom through__

experiential activ-
ities, internships
and professional
networking. Her
interest in diver-
sity has opened a
dialogue and pre-
pared students for
the global environment in which
they will be employed.”
Swoboda joined the UP]
Humanities Division in 1978. She
earned all her degrees from Pitt:
a Ph.D. and an M.A. in rhetoric
and a B.A. in sociology.
According to Swoboda,
“Students learn best when they
accept some responsibility for
their learning, are challenged
by assignments that require them
to think, write and speak about
course materials, receive fair and
constructive criticism of their

 

work, and feel secure enough in
a classroom to take risks.”

Bio-identical hormones including
estriol, estrone, estradiol, and progesterone were not used in this study.‘
For years, physicians have been prescribing bio-identical HRT for
women who have experienced problems or have other concerns about
the use of synthetic hormones. Bio-identical hormones are identical to
hormones that are naturally produced by the human body, and may
relieve symptoms of menopause, including hot ﬂashes, insomnia,
vaginal dryness, and frequent urinary tract infections. Compounding
pharmacists can formulate bio-identical hormones in the strength and
