Hospital revenueiis down and employ-
ee health insurance premiums are up, but
business is good at UPMC Presbyterian
hospital. V

With an 18 percent profit margin in the
past, year and net patient revenue of $920
million, UPMC Presbyterian experienced
the greatest netpatientrevenue of any gen-
eral—care hospital in "Pennsylvania in the
2002 Fiscal Year, according to a report
released by the Pennsylvania Health Care
Cost Containment Council. Net patient rev-
enue reﬂects revenue only from patient
care, and does not take into account revenue
from operations such as research, educa-
tional activities, cafeterias, parking or rent.

But there’s no connection between the
revenue at UPMC Presbyterian or the over-
all 3 or 4 percent profit margin of UPMC
hospitals. last year and the increase in

.employee health insurance costs for the

next year, according to UPMC spokesper-

j son Jane Dufﬁeld.

Pitt’s service employees will pay
almost 75 percent more than they did last
year for family health insurance — provid-
ed through an exclusive relationship with
UPMC Health Plan — in the coming year.

“The, major concern here is that our
members have already been paying $110
per mon ,” said Tom Hoffman, a deputy
trustee for the local chapter ofthe Service
Employees International Union.

Hoffman explained that the monthly
cost for the family plan most popular
among Pitt’s service workers would
increase to $192 next year. 4

“One of the major problems is that the
state’s broke, also,” Hoffman added.

“Pitt really should provide affordable
health care for its workers,” Hoffman said.
He added that members of the health plan
must go to UPMC for health services.

-“It sort of makes you wonder, there —
it’s almost like a monopoly,” Hoffman said
of the relationship between Pitt and "its ,
exclusive health care provider, UPMC.

UPMC and Pitt are now negotiating a
new health care contract, which will replace

Regarding suicide on Pitt’s campus,
James Cox is grateful.

“We’ve been lucky,” the interim
director of the Counseling Center said
solemnly. -Cox recalls only one student
taking his own life in recent history, and
he attributes Pitt’s good fortune to the
wealth of on-campus resources ‘avail-
able to troubled students.

Apparently, Pitt’s services are not
characteristic of other college campus-
es. ‘ .

THE PITT NEWS

Negotiations lowered initial costs

Insurance, page 1

June. g

“One of the things they told us was
that the rates were going up because the
members kept going to the most expen-
sive hospitals,” Hoffman said. “Now
they’re giving us, a plan that makes us go
to the most expensive hospitals. They
ought to be able to come up with afford-
able health care coverage.”

The ﬁnal health care options offered
to employees come at a much lower
price than what was originally offered,
according to Vice Chancellor for Public
Affairs Robert Hill. Months of negotia-
tions’ and plamiing went into the ﬁnal
options, which he said were signiﬁcant-
ly less expensive than theoptions first
brought to the table. —

“We were able-to get the costs from
a prohibitive cost down to a manageable
level,” Hill said, attributing much of the
credit for the smaller increases to “artful
management” by Pitt’s health beneﬁts
negotiators.

_ “Everyone, should be able to ﬁnd
one that works,” Hill said of the new
employee health insurance options,
adding that each employee’s‘ decision
will require “savvy consideration.”

No UPMC spokesperson could.

comment on the private relationship
between UPMC and Pitt, or on the
employee insurance cost increase.

But according to Dufﬁeld,~the fman-
cial difﬁculties facing hospital adminis-
trators across the country have; not

.missed UPMC. She gave credit for the

relative ﬁscal success of UPMC to
“astute financial management,” as well
as the world-renowned researchers and
the “unique array of services” that make

UPMC” Presbyterian particularly suc-

cessful.

“Overall, the system’s experiencing-

a lot of the problems that other health
care systems are,”‘Dufﬁeld said. “The
[UPMC Presbyterian] figures only
reﬂectthe proﬁtability of one hospital,
and not the whole system.”

Although the UPMC system experi-

enced a positive proﬁt margin in a year-

when many hospitals lost money, the
proﬁt must go back into the system for
UPMC to continue its success, accord-
ing to Dufﬁeld. ‘

‘‘All of. the revenue that UPMC
Presbyterian gains"goes back into the
product,” Dufﬁeld said. “We’re very
pleased that we’re doing well and can
still support the research of the
University.” ’

41 percent of Pennsylvania’s gener-
al care» hospitals lost money in the 2002
Fiscal Year, according to the PHC4.
Attributing much of the decline in rev-
enue tola drop in non-operating income
—.- such as investments, trust income and
contributions —- the council reported an
average increase“ of about 7 percent in
expenses for greater stafﬁng costs, mal-

 

practice premiums, drugs and medical
equipment.

Balancing the expense increase,
however, is an average increase of about
7 percent in revenue.

Many Pitt service workers, who
make about $500 a week, may’ opt out of
the more expensive family coverage
plans, instead relying on state-funded
programs to insure their families,
Hoffman said. . '’

On the morning of May 15, in
response to Pitt’s announcement of the
cost increases, some workers gathered
outside the State Ofﬁce Building down-
town to pick up applications for the
Children’s Health Insurance Program, a
state-funded health care program.

An open letter to Athletics Director Long

Dear Athletics Director Long:

Welcome to Pitt. You’re new here, but
probably know that Pitt athletics is facing
a major identity crisis: We need to change
conferences in order to remain competi-
tive in football and men’s basketball.

This crisis is not unexpected. Miami
has been toying with switching to the
Atlantic Coast Conference for some
months. Losing the Big East’s best foot-
ball team would pull money and television
time away from the conference and,’there-
fore, away from Pitt. Moreover, Syracuse
and Boston College are also thinking of
jumping ship, leaving Pitt with little
choice but to change conferences.

But in order to prepare Pitt for this, we
need your help. As senior assistant athlet-
ics director at Oklahoma, you dealt with
new arenas, ticket sales and fund-raising.
Vifrth the Pete in action and basketball
ticket sales overhauled — though not a
paragon of efficiency or sanity — we need
to go further. There is one sale left to
make.

Pitt needs to be able to sell its athlet-
ics programs as a solid investment. To do
this, we need to prove that we are mar-
ketable, which means that we can pack
stadiums with fans, play against big
names — no more Arkansas—Pine Bluff —
and, most importantly, get our games tele-
vised with high ratings despite Pittsburgh
not being a lucrative market.

These changes will not be easy to
implement. Not only must we drop the

Big East like a hot rock, but we must also
gain acceptance to another conference.

Where does this leave you? You’ve
worked for schools in many of the major
conferences — the Big 12, Big Ten and
ACC, in addition to the Big East —— and
should use these connections. Shop
around for a conference and show others
that Pitt is a good sale.

Moreover, show us — Pitt’s students
—— that joining another conference will
beneﬁt us. Any decision you make,
including staying put, will be controver-
sial. For instance, if we join‘ the Big Ten,
we lose our annual football game with
West Virginia and gain one with Penn
State. Though we know that both are far
inferior to Pitt in every way — cue mani-
acal laughter — sacriﬁcing one rivalry for
another might notsell well.

We’ll do our part as fans by packing
games and occasionally setting things on
ﬁre, as long as you do yours as AD.

7 Last, we need to demonstrate that
switching conferences will enhance, not
endanger, our ability to recruit good play-
ers. As we said, success depends on play-
ing worthy teams and showing that
Pittsburgh can be a moneymaking enter-
prise.

-You’ve been handed a big challenge.
Do what you need to do and we’ll try to -
support the program.

Sincerely,
The Editorial Board

Shooting, obstinacy affect debates

When it became clear that I could test my

down to a simple question of
whether I liked killing things.

Nor did their lack of skill at debating
imply that they were less intelligent and
therefore less convincing. They merely
lacked experience.

Most of those who raised
objections to my hunting did

with hunting on a moral level,

What to do if the Big East is nomore: a point—counterpoint

The Big East’s collapse is inevitable.
When — not if —- Miami leaves the
Big East for the Atlantic Coast

lure for television contracts. If that isn’t

enough, Boston College and Syracuse

why Miami is leaving for the ACC — it
can make more money there. In the Big

Now that we’ve hired a new athlet-

should lobby for our admission to the
Big Ten at the beginning of the 2004
football season. Here are my top 10 rea-
sons why:

10. If the Big East survives, it will
be as an all-basketball conference, with
Georgetown, Villanova, Providence, etc.
as its backbone. If Pitt football is to con-
tinue successfully, we will have to find a
new home.

Pitt if the conference is to split into two
divisions. At eleven teams, the Big Ten
has to play a rotating schedule in football
that prevents rivals, like Michigan and
Ohio State, from playing each other cer-
tain years. Having two, six-team divi-
sions would ensure that geographic
rivals could play each other every year.
Rotation would occur only with non-
rival schools.

There is a storm brewing in southern
Florida, but Mother Nature didn’t cause this
hurricane. This storm isdriven by money,
and it could rip the Big East apart.

The Atlantic Coast Conference wants to
expand in order to add television markets
and a conference championship game.

set its sights on Miami, Boston

Just because Joe Pa thinks it’s a good
idea to join the Big Ten doesn’t mean that the
rest of the conference does, or even that it is
a good idea.

Besides, why would Pitt
want to join a conference that
can’t even count the number of

One scenariothatseemstobepopularis
that Pitt should join the Big Ten. While this
would renew the Pitt-Penn State rivalry, it
will not, and should not, happen. Pitt would
bring nothing to the Big Ten.

The conference already has, in Penn
State, a strong drawing from the Pittsburgh
television market. Adding Pittpwould not add
new viewers, and thus no new money, which
equals no invitation to join the conference.

Dame because the Fighting
Irish have one of the most proliﬁc football
programs in the nation, and their fairs travel
all over the country to see them

Pitt has a hard enough time drawing
fans to its home games. Never mind the fact
that Notie Dame has its own television deal,
which is something that Pitt, as it stands,
could never pull off.

While staying in the Big East won’t
work, stayingwiththeteamsthatareinthe
Big East will work. Why not do what the
ACC is doing and raid another conference,

Pitt needs to join Big Ten

Lawrence, page 5

6. The Big Ten isn’t the Mid-
American Conference, which was
reported as one of Pitt’s options when
the Big East collapses. There’s a huge
difference between Ohio University and
Ohio State. Compare having automatic

bids to the Motor City Bowl and bids to .

a Bowl Championship Series Bowl, such
as the Cotton or Sugar Bowls. If we
don’t join the Big Ten, Ohio and Toledo
are likely to remain permanent ﬁxtures
on our football schedule.

5. The Big Ten isn’t Conference
USA. Conference USA is our best
option after the Big Ten, but it’s still not
desirable. While solid in-basketball, it’s
weak in football; Moreover, it’s not a
major conference. With schools like

South Florida and East Carolina, it, does- -

n’t compare to larger ones. This confer-
ence is suited for West Virginia, not Pitt.

4. I grew up in Big Ten country. I’ve
seen that Big Ten fans are better than Big
East fans, because they travel and care

about football.

3. Pittsburgh is a cultural part of the
Midwest, not the East. Ohio State, Penn
State, Michigan and Michigan State are
closer opponents than Philly area
schools, Syracuse or Virginia Tech. Just
as Miami belongs in the ACC, we
belong in the Big Ten.

2. Pitt belongs to the Association of
American Universities, an academic
benchmark for joining the Big Ten. Also,
by joining the Big Ten, Pitt will become
better known in the Midwest. Joining the
Big Ten can increase and extend our
applicant pool. ’

1. Miss playing Penn State and
chanting “P-e—n—n S—t SUCKS” at
games? Me too. Joining the Big Ten

guarantees us a football game and home 9

basketball games with them every year.
'I‘here’s no better reason to join the Big
Ten.

Jason Lawrence also wants to see Pitt
play his home-state Iowa Hawkeyes. E-
mail him at jlawrence @pittnews.com

Big Ten doesn’t need 12 teams

Marchilena, page 5

like the Mid-American Conference or
Conference USA?

I_et’s imagine a conference made up of
the ﬁve leftover, Big East teams and
Louisville, Cincinnati, South Florida and

Memphis. There would be nine teams e-— I

one more than the Big East currently has.

While it won’t make the conference’s
football status better, it will improve the con-
ference’s basketball status. _

But that also means that the Big East, or
whatever the conference would be called,
would have to jettison the six members that
don’t participate in football. That means say-
ing good—bye to Georgetown, St. John’s,
Villanova, Seton Hall, Providence and Notre
Dame. Still, a basketball conference with
Pitt, Connecticut, Louisville, Cincinnati and
Memphis would be pretty good. Ifthat does-
n’t work out, Pitt could always join the
MAC orConference USA. It can’t be that

bad, right? Pitt plays the conference’s' teams

every year anyway, so, in a way, joining
them would be keeping the status quo.

Since 1999, Pitt has scheduled 22 non-
conference games, including those in the.
upcoming season. Of those 22 games, 12 of
them have been against schools like Kent
State, Bowling Green and Toledo..All three
of those teams aremembers of the MAC.
Right now Pitt is just an unofﬁcial member,
and making the membership oﬂicial by
‘moving to the MAC wouldn’tbe that bad.

Pitt hardly ever loses to those teams, so
there’s the potential for an undefeated sea—.
son, which would also mean that Pitt has a
great shot at a meaningless bowl game every
year. That hasn’t happened in a long time,
now has it? , 9

But no matter what Conference Pitt does
end up in, it shouldn’t be a conference where
the number 10 actually means 11.

disappoints  

Hamlet

Through May 24

Directed by Andrew S. Paul
Pittsburgh Irish and Classical a
Theatre

(412) 561-6000
‘A’

CLARE PERRETTA
Staff Writer

. Danish prince, scholar, friend,
mourner,. narcissist, betrayer,
betrayed, mama’s boy, lover, killer,
sissy pants: Hamletis a jumble of
contradictions.

And so, sometimes,
could‘ use a Xanax.

In Andrew S. Paul’s psychother-
apy-inflected production , of
Shakespeare’s — and the English
language’s '— best play, the need
for mood—enhancing drugs unfor-
tunately becomes apparent very
early in the performance.

The play begins auspiciously,
with a usefully brief and silent
scene of the burial of King
Hamlet. This scene, a helpful one
not in the original text of the
play, lays out the two major rela-
tionships in the play: loyal son
Hamlet brooding over his dead
father, and Gertrude planning her
union with Claudius.

From there, however, things
tend toward chaos. ,

The production spins off into
melodrama when we get .to the
first big set piece of the play.
When Hamlet and Gertrude share
their first of several decidedly
Oedipal kisses, the eyes of any-
one who has more than a passing
familiarity with “Hamlet” (read:
pretty much anybody who’s seen
the Mel Gibson or Kenneth
Branagh versions of “Hamlet,” or
even, you know, actually read the
play) begin to roll.‘

Paul seems to think that his
audience has never heard of this
Shakespeare fellow, and the
actions on stage are portrayed
with all the subtlety of acast-iron
skillet to the right temple. During

Hamlet

the pantomime that opens the play,
when Claudius and Gertrude come
together and almost kiss, meddling
blowhard Polonius steps between
them with a reproachful look while
Hamlet glowers on.

Ophelia, played with an unset-
tling naivete, and her big, blustery
brother Laertes — who takes after

his daddy, it seems — say a

smoochy, Angelina Jolie-and-her-
creepy-brother goodbye and cling
to each other while Polonius yam-
mers on about to thine own self
being true.

When the player king enters
with the troupe of actors and stuns
everyone with the evocative Hecuba
monologue, we recognize him as
the ghost of King Hamlet. ’

Whenever something important
happens — the “to be or not to be”
monologue, or the players’ perfor-

‘mance for the royal family, for

example —- a single note pulses on
the soundtrack like on a particular-
ly “dramatic” episode of “ER.”

See what happened there? Do
you get it? Are you sure?

Because your neighbor has time
to explain to you during the long,
long pauses between scenes" that
stretch the first act to ‘a whopping
90 minutes, giving you lots and lots
of time to think about what just
happened.

Sidebar: I had never been to a
play where the ushers actually warn
the audience about the play’s
length. Then again, on the nightl
attended the play, the majority of
the audience were senior citizens.
Infer from that what you wish.

Everything in this production of
Hamlet is so over the top‘ that the

‘ gigantic performances suit it. Scott

Ferrara -acquits himself nicely as a
narcissistic, postmodern’ Hamlet
who reads too much Kierkegaard
and doesn’t get enough sunlight or
protein. (Ferrara, incidentally,
looks like the result of putting
Ralph Fiennes, Joseph Fiennes, Jeff
Goldblum and a black eyeliner pen-

cil in a blender and pressing
“puree.”)

Helena Ruoti turns in a glori-
ously oversexed performance as
Gertrude — she seems equally
turned on by her son and her new
husband, Claudius, played with the
appropriate amounts of condescen-
sion and ambition by Darren Eliker.

Tessa K1ein’s Ophelia is grat-
ingly girlish and naive, and, more
creepily, she can’t seem to keep her
lips, off of Matthew Gaydos’

uncharacteristically grandiose
frock—coated and brilliantined
Laertes —— though really, who
could? '

The combination of overblown
performances, tedious directorial
tics and an incredibly superficial
reference to Tom Stoppard’s play,
“Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are
Dead,” combine to make the viewer
silently plead, as Gertrude ’so
famously does, “More matter, with
less art.”

Love, ‘80s style

Getting over Jack Wagner
Elise Juska
Pocket Books

2003
vikikik

The decade of the ‘80s brought with it totally‘
rad music — Prince, Rick Springﬁeld, Duran
Duran, Pat Benatar and The Cure, to name a few.
Songs by the above artists and many others pro-
vide the soundtrack to Elise Juska’s debut novel,
“Getting Over Jack Wagner.” A list of suggested
tunes opens each chapter; the songs’ themes par-
allel each chapter’s theme.

After yet another failed relationship with a
“rock star,” a disastrous blind date with a securi-
ties analyst and several life—altering announce-
ments from some of the most important people in
her life, protagonist Eliza embarks on a soul-
searching journey. What follow are reﬂections
v back» to her childhoodand teenage years, when
she was coping with her father’s abandonment of
her family. ' ,

The abrupt ﬂashbacks to her early’ years,
occurring every other chapter, are a bit confusing
at first, but in order for Eliza’s story to be told in

rized. Some of her “rock star” conquests include

A a high school concert band saxophonist, an angst-

ridden drummer sans a band and a nonexistent
relationship with an upstairs neighbor whom she

. pretends is a world—renowned concert pianist.

As with most stereotyped groups, musicians
aren’t always what they are supposed to be. They
should be deep, brooding, tough men with a sen-
sitive side that shines through here and there.
What happens, then, when that wall crumbles
down, only to reveal that the rock star in question
is no more than your average Joe, who happens to
be musically inclined? The answer is the end of
Eliza’s time with him.

Musician/actor Jack Wagner is the foundation
of her rock star obsession, and until she can get
closure with her childhood crush, she can’t get
closure on her real love life. Of course, the song
that she muses over time and time again in the
novel is Wagner’s “All I Need.” In reality, all
Eliza needs is to realize that‘love is nothing like
her favorite Wagner song.

The story is told in first person and isgpart
autobiography, part ﬁction. Juska pens the story
in a colorful fashion; lessons in pop culture, love
and ﬁnding oneself are the core of the novel, with
each lesson depending on the others to keep the
book aﬂoat. It’s a quick, painless read and, at
times, it can be a bit predictable. The ﬂashbacks
to the ‘80s really‘ make “Getting Over Jack
Wagner” "worth the read, especially if you ever
had a doll with Xavier Robert’s signature on its
backside.

Down With Love
Starring Ewan McGregor, Renee Zellweger,
David Hyde Pierce, Sarah Paulson

Directed by Peyton Reed
72:72:71‘: 1/2

There is a trend in American ﬁlm in which ﬁlm-
makers are experimenting with homages to other
ﬁlmmakers, or moments, in a new, inventive way.
Films like “Far From Heaven,” “Auto Focus” and
“Catch Me if You Can,” and, to a lesser degree,
“Confessions of a Dangerous Mind”, are constructed
entirely in the style of a bygone era or eras of ﬁlm-
making.

“Down with Love, director Peyton Reed’s
homage to the sex comedies of the Sixties, starring
Ewan McGregor and Renee Zellweger, is the latest
addition to this new genre. - *

_ McGregor is Catcher Block, “lady’s man, man’s
man, man about town,” and writer for the magazine
“Know.” He’s suave, debonair and misogynistic —
everything the slick, hipster heroes from ‘60s roman-
tic comedies were. i _

Zellweger is Barbara Novak, writer of the book
“Down with Love.” It teaches women to be just like
men: forego love, have meaningless sex as often as
possible and go out into the workforce. It’s a fad fash-

99

Judy Garland appears on “The Ed Sullivan Show” to

to trap Barbara, expose her as a fake and write a
scathing expose to redeem men. But, of course, noth-
ing goes as planned.

The ﬁlm is open, breathy, fast and fun. The char-
acters exist in the world but seem to ﬂoat through it.
America, circa 1962, is meticulously replicated in the
sets, costumes and dialogue; in the opening credits

are just as good in the supporting roles. The
comedies of the ‘60s depended on strong
supporting performances, and this one does
as well. Both actors are up to the task and
play their roles with the requisite amount of
humor, without going over the top.

, “Down with Love” isn’t a perfect
experiment; there are moments of mod-
ernism that, whilefew and. far between, take
the audience out of the meticulously detailed

and recreated world of 1962 that Reed constructs. But
this hardly mars what is otherwise an excellent ﬁlm

A voice is a terrible thing to waste.
Worse yet, wasting a strong, vibrant
voice is nothing short of aﬁmusical

this offense throughout their debut
full-length album, Forever To Tell.
The Strokes ‘reinvented ' the

Enter a new musical wave, complete

with The Vines, The Hives, The White 4

vocalist is female.

_ Scratchy guitar riffs and pounding
percussion solidify the new-wave sig-

distorted voice weakens the final
product. The girl has a set of lungs —
that’s apparent. Why, then, would the

sexily shrieks and screams “uh huhs”
on “Black Tongue” and howls on
“Man.” When her » un—reverberated
voice is finally unleashed on “Maps”
and “Modern Romance,” she croons
the lyrics softly, and a Lucinda
Williams twang shines through.

The album cover carries a Parental

The Eaves had received acclaim
from already-established bands before
their first album was released. That’s
an incredible feat. The trio just
released their self-titled debut album
on the New York-based independent
label Ace Fu Records, and they have
already landed gigs with The
Walkmen, Yeah Yeah Yeahs and
French Kicks. "

The Eaves are made up of Jen
Adam, Casey Sweten and Quentin
Rowan. Adam’s beautiful voice pro-
vides for a graceful harmony that
ﬂoats overtop of an intricate and
poppy rhythm section and steady gui-
tar riffs.

Doing something that other New
York—based bands don’t has helped
The Eaves receive acclaim. The songs
on this album are surprisingly beauti-
ful and hauntingly intriguing.

The album is relatively short,
made up of only seven songs. These
songs last 35 minutes and get better
the more you listen to them.

The self-titled debut was also self-
produced, as the trio worked out all
the kinks the way they wanted to. A
U.S. tour is currently in the works for
The Eaves, and hopefully their stage
show is as intriguing and surprising as
their debut release.

JOE l'l\_/IARCHILENA
' Sports Editor

The search is finally over.

After goingfive months without
an athletics director, Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg announced on
Friday the hiring of Jeff Long, for-

- mer senior associate athletics direc-

tor at Oklahoma, to fill the void left

‘by Steve Pederson’s departure in

December. ' A

Long, who spent the past two:

years working with the Sooners
program, has more than two
decades of experience in collegiate
athletics, spending time on both the
administrative and coaching side.
“It would be a dramatic under-
statementto say thatl am excited to‘
be here and tobe a member of the

University of Pittsburgh athletics_
‘ program,” Long said during a press

conference, Friday. ‘‘I have a great
respect for the academic and athlet-
ic traditions of this institution and
am proud to become a part of it. My
initial goal is to build upon the
‘momentum that has been gathering
the past several years.”

“In human terms, Jeff is a won-

9

derful person,’ Nordenberg said.
“In termsof his professional abili-
ties, Jeff is a real star. Everyone we

‘ talked to who knew Jeff’s work had

the same things to say about him.”

Nordenberg went
on to say that Long’s
experience of working
with T some of “the
country’s strongest
athletics programs” as

“This is just a
great hire...Jeﬁ‘

tremendous, tremendous individual.
The people in the Pittsburgh-com-
munity will love working with and
getting to know Jeff. They’ve hired
a big—time winner.”

B At Oklahoma, Long saw dona-
tions to the athletics
department increase
each year and helped
create a new student

Long’S first

task: find a
conference

JOE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

As Pitt’s interim athletics director,
Marc Boehm left his ﬁngerprints on the
program by hiring three new head coaches
and creating a new football season—ticket
package.

But none of that compares to what Jeff
Long will have to face in the early part of
his tenure as the athletics director at Pitt

While Boehm moves on to Nebraska
to join Steve Pederson’s staff, Long arrives
at Pitt to face the possibility that the Big
East could be on the verge of folding.

Despite receiving infonnal invitations
from the Atlantic Coast Conference to help
it expand, Miami, Syracuse and Boston
College have yet to announce if they will
leave the Big East;

While discussions among the Big
East’s administrators have been taking
place throughout the past week, Long and
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg would not
comment, Friday, on what would happen to
Pitt if the conference were to dissolve.

“We’re in the Big East conference,”
Long said. “I think we, as an administration,
are looking to anticipate things that may
occur, but it’s premature to say that there
will be changes.”

“It is our hope that the Big East confer-
ence will emerge from this discussion even
stronger than it has been in the past,”
Nordenberg added. “We’re exploring a
range of alternatives to strengthen the con-
ference, but there wouldn’t be anything pro-
ductive in my saying more about that now.”

So far, it seems that conference‘ offi-
cials and the other members of the Big East
have been trying to convince not only
Miami, but also Syracuse, to stay in the Big
East. Syracuse appears to be the most reluc-
tant to leave the conference, and if the
Orangemen decide to stay, and no other

school accepts an invitation in place of ,

them, the ACC’s proposal could collapse.

If the Big East, as it stands now, does
fold, there is no telling what conference Pitt
could end up in. Nordenberg may have had
that in mind when hiring Long.

- “Looking at Jeff’s resume, I think he
has worked for some of the ﬁnest confer-
ences,” Nordenberg Said. “He’s in .a posi-
tion to reach out and make contacts.”

Long has worked for schools in the Big
Ten, Big 12 and ACC. ’

Pitt loses two of three to UConn to end the year

RYAN WALKER
For The Pitt News

The baseball team entered the weekend
holding on to a slinr playoff chance, but a
series loss to Connecticut dashed Pitt’s play-
off hopes for good. After the Panthers May
13 home game against Akron was cancelled,
the Panthers traveled to Stone, Conn. to take
on the Huskies. The team split a double-
header on Saturday and dropped the ﬁnal
game of the season on Sunday. .

Pitt ﬁnished the year 36-20 overall
the second straight year the Panﬂiers have
won 36 games —— and 13-13 in the Big East
The Huskies ﬁnished the year 24-23 overall
and 10-15 in the conference.

UConn 3, Pitt 0 ~
Nick Tucci pitched a complete garn
shutout, allowing just four hits over seven
innings and striking out two. '
The Huskies drew ﬁrst blood in their
half of the fourth inning. After leading olf the
inning with a double, Bryan Maler scored on

a sacriﬁce fly by Mike Mocerino.

’ UConn added two insurance runs in the
bottom of the sixth with a little help from an
error by second baseman Scott Folrnar.
Folrnar bobbled a ground ball hit by David
Tokarz, allowing Maler and Mike Leonard
to score. ' ‘

Mike Scanzano led Pitt with two hits,
and Nick Evangelista pitched six innings,
allowing three runs on six hits. _

Pitt 3, UConn 1

The teams started the game by trading
runs in the ﬁrst inning.

After Ben Copeland scored on a sacri-
ﬁce ﬂy by Tom Cashman in the top of the
ﬁrst, the Huskies responded when Maler
drew a walk, forcing home Tony Mallozzi.

Pitt went back on top, 3-1, in the ﬁfth
inning, following RBIs by Copeland and
Stuart Rykaceski. Michael Bell led the
Panthers with two hits. '

After giving up the early run, Don
Rhoten held the Huskies scoreless for 6 2/3
innings, striking out six and allowing just

four hits. Rhoten also picked up the win, his
fourth on the season
Adam Luckette and Brian Jacobson 1

pitched the ﬁnal 2 1/3 innings, allowing just
one hit. Tim Norton‘ picked up the loss for
UConn.  * '

UConn 10, Pitt 4

Pittsburgh got off to a good start in the
ﬁrst inning when Rykaceski reached ﬁrst
base on an error, stole second and later
scored after Huskies’ catcher Leonard made
two throwing errors.

The Huskies responded by scoring three
runs in the bottom ofthe ﬁfth inning to take
the lead. UConn’s Peter Soteropoulos hit a
two-rim single and then’ scored after Brett
Bumlram singled to bring him home.

In the next inning, Rykaceski tied the
game at three with one swing of the bat His
two-run home run was just his second of the
year, but came at a good time for the

, Panthers.

Alex Rybczak’s RBI in the top of the

seventh gave Pitt the lead, 4-3, but after that, 0

JIM EIBEN
For The Pitt News

It seems as though the Pitt track
team is not fazed by major champi-
onship meets. In fact, they seem to
improve as the meets get bigger.

Coming off an impressive, third-
place performance at the Big East
Championships earlier in the month, the
Pitt women won the Eastern College
Athletic Championship last weekend, in
Princeton, N.J., by an overwhehning
margin of 114-68 over second-place
Georgetown.

The Panthers had four individual 7

champions and won two relay events.

Trenace Elliott finished ﬁrst in the
400 meters with a time of 54.10 sec-
onds. She was also on both of the win-
ning relay teams — the 4 X 100 team
and the 4 X 400 team.

' f ' t 1   
Rounding out the rest of the 4 X
100 team were Kimberly Lyles, Lamoy
Stephens and Nicole Vann, while the 4
X 400 team included Lyles, Stephens
and Elizabeth Bayne.

Bayne was also the winner of the
400-meter hurdles event, finishing with
a time of 57.95 seconds.

The other Pitt champions were
Amanda Walker, who took home the
shot put title with a throw of 15.04
meters, and Melanie Carter,-—who won
the triple jump with a distance of 12.96
meters.

While the Panther men did not
achieve their goal of finishing in the top
10, their 21st place performance was a
17-place improvement over last year’s
38th place ﬁnish. The team accumulat-
ed 18.5 points.

Matt Brousse ﬁnished third in the

' pole vault, clearing a height of 4.90

meters. Brousse was Pitt,’s top ﬁnisher,

among the men, in the meet. Shawndel _

Daniel also had a solid meet, taking
ﬁfth place in the long jump with a mark
of 7.21 meters. _ 0

Despite the fact that this year’s
squad has a new coaching staff, led by
head coach Alonzo Webb, and does not
have a home track, the Panthers have
come a long way in a short amount of
time. -

Webb said his team’s progress has
“surprised a lot of people” in the Big
East who have watched Pitt take big
strides in just a “matter of months.”

The NCAA Regional
Championships start May 29 in Fairfax,
Va., and Pitt will send 11 men and 12
women to the meet. Should any
Panthers qualify, they will travel to
Sacramento, Calif., for the NCAA
Championships on June 10.

most doubles in a season, with 18, while

junior shortstop Bryan Spamer broke the sin— 4 '
