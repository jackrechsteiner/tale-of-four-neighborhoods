Hormone treatment acts
as a male contraceptive

CHRISTIAN NIEDAN
Staff Writer

Men may soon be an injection away from tem-
porarily not having to worry about impregnating
their partners -during sex. ‘ ' A

A recent study, conducted by the ANZAC
-Research Institute in Australia, found that an injec-
tion of the hormone depot medroxyprogesterone
acetate, or DMPA, every three months inhibited
male sperm production enough to qualify as reliable
‘contraception. ’ I

The study, the results of which were published
in the October issue of The Journal of Clinical
Endocrinology and Metabolism, was conducted
over 5 years and involved 55 couples, who experi-

enced no pregnancies during _the up—to—12-month '

period each man used the injection. Prggestin is a
synthetic form of the female sex hormone proges-

-  terone, which women produce to regulate their men-

strual cycle. V V.
While there were no major health"sideje_ffects,
according to study results, the progestin reduced the

male sex drive along with sperm production, and
testosterone had to be introduced into the -body _

through honnone implants about once every four
months to maintain previous libido. , .
After as much as a year of treatment, study par-
ticipants stopped taking the injections and recovered
previous sperm rates and sexvdrive. . . »

ANZAC researchers said that, with the right‘
: honnonal balance, men taking such injections can
achieve temporarily low sperm levels that are usual-

ly only possible through a vasectomy, the surgical

form of male contraception that blocks spenn from
reaching semen. ’

According to ANZAC, the region of Australia
and New Zealand where the study was conducted
hasthe highest rate of vasectomy in the world.

ANZAC researchers say that by having and .

injection every few months, men can forget’ about
the potential pregnancy hazard of their partners‘ for-
getting to take birth control, pills. They‘ added that it
was up to pharmaceutical companies, who would
pick up the results of the study, to decide which com-

mercial form, pill or injection, the contraceptive V

would take. A
I A contraceptive injection for women using
DMPA, called Depo-Provera and made by Pﬁzer, is

"already on the market.

According to plaimedparenthood.org, the
Depo-Provera shot is most commonly given in the
arm or buttock and acts as a contraceptive in women
by preventing the ovaries ﬁom releasing eggs and
preventing sperm from joining those eggs. I I

According to The Emory University
Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, a
woman taking Depo-Provera every 3 months for a
year has a 3 in 1000, or 0.3 percent, chance_of
becoming pregnant during unprotected sex. ‘

I Dr. Carla Fox, who isa clinical professor at The
University of California San Diego A School of
Medicineand also works in private practice, thinks
Depo-Provera could give men some insight into the
advantages and disadvantages of such a form of con-
traception.‘

Miami sues teams in Big East, schools countersue

KEVIN NASH
Contributing Editor

The University of Miami ﬁled suit
against the Big East Conference and four of
the conference’s schools Monday, according
to ESPN;com.

Miami, along with Vnginia Tech and
Boston College, plans to leave the Big East

Conference for the Atlantic Coast

Conference. Miami and Virginia Tech will
leave the conference at the end of the current
academic calendar year. Boston College will
possibly not be leaving the conference until
Pitt, along with the University of

Connecticut, West Virginia University and .

Rutgers. University were named in the suit,
in which Miami claimed it suffered “sub-

stantial monetary damage by remaining in

the league.” Those schools are counter-suing
Miami, claiming that it was involved in a

conspiracy with the ACC to weaken the Big

East. . _

In a separate action,‘ Miami ﬁled a law-
suit against Connecticut for defamation.
Both suits were ﬁled in circuit courts in

Miami will seek an undetermined
amount in damages, according to the

school’s attorney Eric lsicoff.

“'Ihere’s a lot of issues here about the
harm that’s been caused,” Isicoif reportedly
said. “It’s going to be a huge sum of money.”

John Paquette, a Big East spokesman,
acknowledged that representatives from the
conference had Seen the lawsuit, but they
had no comment regarding it Pit1’s athletics
department also declined to comment at the
time.

“It’s convenient in the sense that you
can take it every 3 months and forget about
it, but it has been associated with side
eifects in women using it,” Fox said.

According to depo-users.com, an infor-
mation resource Web site for women using
Depo-Provera, known side effects of Depo-
Provera include menstrual changes, weight
gain, depression, and hormonal ﬂuctuation.

According to Fox, oral contraceptives,
or birth control pills, are still the most pop-

 ular form of physical contraception for her

female patients. She said of all the current
options‘ for male contraception — including

condoms and vasectomy — there is no con-
venient male equivalent to “the pill.”

Some male Pitt students, who were
asked if they wouldpuse such a contracep-
tive injection, weren’t convinced it would
become a more popular option for men than
using condoms. , p

Mike Gillen, a freshman studying
Physical Therapy, was concerned about a
reduced libido and the risk of contracting
sexually transrnitted diseases.

“I wouldn’t use it, because if you can’t ,..-5
stay in ‘working order’ and you’re ‘not 
tected from STDs,- it’s really not worth‘  s
using it,” said Gillen. “Condoms work bet- t

ter anyway.”

Students worried about side effects of treatment

Aaron Bumbarger, a junior economics
major, said he wouldn’t use such an injec-
tion because he didn’t like the fact that he
had to rely on artiﬁcially low sperm levels

to ensure against pregnancy.

Almost no sperm’ isn’t ‘no spe1m,’”
Bumbarger said. “What happens if you’ve
got a couple of Olympic swimmers coming
out of [you]?”

Justin Stone, a junior microbiology stu-
dent, was wary of possible side effects and
said he probably wouldn’t use the injection

College student embarasses FBI, TSA

Nathaniel Heatwole threatened
national’ security on six separate occa-
sions, introducing banned materials
onto airplanes, keeping records of his
activities and sending the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the
Transportation Security Administration
and Homeland Security Secretary Tom
Ridge into a tizzy.

And now a judge has released him
on his own recognizance.

Heatwole, 20, is a student at
Guilford College in Greensboro, N.C.
He planted box cutters, clay intended
to look like plastic explosives, matches
and bleach in airplane lavatory com-
partments — then e—mailed federal
authorities to report the security breach
on Southwest Airlines.

It took five weeks to locate the
items.

Aside from the obligatory outrage
— ﬁve weeks, how could this happen?
-- it seems that what the TSA and FBI
lack is creativity.

“Amateur testing of our systems do
not show us, in any way, our flaws,”
Deputy TSA administrator Stephen
McHale said in an Oct. 20 Associated
Press article.

Actually, that’s exactly what
Heatwole’s tests showed. As embar-
rassing as this is for national agencies,
it reveals that the biggest flaw in secu-
rity is not even tangible — it’s their
unwillingness to be ﬂexible.

Each time someone breaches
national security, these agencies react.
— and thus no one can violate security
in the same ‘way.

Instead of being reactive, why
doesn’t Homeland Security become
active and recruit innovative thinkers
to do what they clearly cannot -—— con-

ceive outlandish, but possible, scenar- I

ios and determine how to prevent
them.

What Heatwole did was not even
that creative, but he did introduce a
new variable in the effort to keep air-
lines safe. Apparently, people can leave
objects — bleach, box cutters and, per-
haps, bomb components — on planes
indeﬁnitely. Instead of trying to pre-
vent one person from boarding a plane
with something deemed hazardous,
security agencies should now look for
people at different airports, trying to
coordinate schemes. Shouldn’t that
have been one of their scenarios?

And shouldn’t the airlines sweep
the planes every so often? Shouldn’t
dangerous materials be removed and
reported, and not be allowed to lan-
guish for five weeks?

What Heatwole did was cocky, but
necessary. If public embarrassment is
required for Ridge to act, then so be it.
Public embarrassment is preferable to
tragedy, and Heatwole showed the
potential for such tragedy. If only the
authorities had responded well. '

Rememberingworld hunger in the Land of the Obese

By the time you ﬁnish reading this column, 85 people
will have died from a preventable cause. Even if you use all
the talents college has allowed you to master, and spend a
minute skimming, in that time, the avoidable killer will have
taken the lives of 17 people, because every
mere minute, 17 people die of starvation.

VV1th that last line, I fear this column lost a
hefty amount of readers. World hunger? Who
wants to read about that? It’s hardly a novel or
controversial concept ,

Plus, death by starvation is difficult for us
to fully understand. After all, we live in the

 

Americans make up 12 million of the 840 million peo-
ple, according to the USAID Web site, suffering from mal-
nutrition. Eight hundred and forty million. I wish I had some
brilliant metaphor to express how large an amount that is. I
don’t, because I have no conception of such a
large number.

But the 2000 United States Census report-
ed that 28l million people live in the U.S. If we
imagine everyone here and multiply that by
three, that’s how many people don’t have
enough to eat. _

But perhaps the greatest tragedy with
hunger is that it is completely‘ urmecessary.

Eating Disorders. According to the Oxfam America Web site,
I’m not exempt from either category. If I Maria Wrzosek _ there are more than enough resources to supply

in the ice cream family, I roll around on the
ﬂoor, clutch my stomach and groan that I’m
wasting away to nothing. Also, I’m sure I’ve passed up a
meal in order to look a nanometer skinnier.

V But, as Pitt— students, we are more in touch with the out-
side world than are many at conﬁned college campuses. Our
campus spreads into Oakland. Our sidewalks are shared
with the homeless. Our volunteer organizations spend time
at soup kitchens and homeless shelters. And it wouldbe
shocking if no reader experienced hunger ﬁrsthand. ‘

t , Thirty thousand children die‘ every day because of
hunger. That’s equivalent to Pitt’s entire student body —
including the graduate schools — dying each day. Hunger is

not only a problem in countries featured in sponsor-a-child ,

cancer‘ or AIDS was discovered, shouldn’t
everything be done to ensure every suffering
individual received the life-saving cure? The same logic
should_ be applied to eradicate hunger.

With so many problems plaguing our world, one natur-
al response is to hide from them all. When I have a gazillion
things to do, I have the fabulous habit of not doing anything.
I fear that if I attempt to complete my homework, I’ll real-
ize how much there is to do, become overwhelmed, have a
nervous breakdown, and my roommates will force me to
move to Tower C. But doing something would be better
than nothing. The same goes for addressing a worldwide cri-

The ﬁrst step is not being bored by hunger news or
other life—threatening issues. ‘We’re bombarded by the

world’s problems, so it’s no surprise that we’re numb. But
there’s nothing preventing us from snapping out of it and
realizing that things can change.

I’m a fan of minimal effort. One way Pitt makes help—
ing the local hunger situation extremely easy is by allowing
us to donate extra meal blocks in Eddie’s cafeteria and
Schenley Cafe. While it’s nice to have 593 bottles of water,
even giving up one block a week makes a dent and, just as
important, makes you involved.

If you’re feeling extra ambitious, you can move onto

Phase II: long—terrn solutions. Find out reasons for our -

severe hunger’ problem. For example, the coffee industry has
become destructive to many developing nations. Coffee
farmers’ proﬁts have decreased 70 percent in the last ﬁve
years.

College students are coffee experts, and we know there
hasn’t been a decline in price or demand. Fair Trade
Certiﬁed Coffee is coffee that offers farmers a fair price.
Various retailers, including Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts
offer Fair Trade Coﬁee, but often you have to speciﬁcally
ask for it. You can also go to www.vote-smartorg to see how
government oﬁicials respond to hunger and other issues.

If nothing else, enjoy the food you have. As I write this
hunger diatribe, a meal, in crumbs, lives under my laptop
keys, and I’m sure I have some sort of sauce on my face. But
I try to be grateful for each morsel. I hope that, as you’re
reading this, your favorite food is dribbling all over this arti-
cle, my lovely picture included. Just be grateful you have the
luxury of doing so.

“Aml hot or moo”: the 2004 presidential version

The ﬁrst televised presidential debates on

sass—machine so friggin’ hot that he could talk .

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906

Dive into local history

Fallingwater Rising: Frank Lloyd
Wright, E.J. Kaufmann, and
America’s Most Extraordinary
House

Franklin Toker

Alfred A. Knopf Publishing

2002
ﬁikﬁ 1/2

Franklin Toker has written a splendid book
chronicling the construction of Fallingwater,
Frank Lloyd Wright’s famous house over a
waterfall just 45 minutes south of Pittsburgh.
But he doesn’t just describe the house. Toker
takes us through everything associated with
Fallingwater. He is a biographer of iPittsburgh’s
Kaufmann family and Frank Lloyd Wright, and
has done extensive research on Bear Run, the
creek‘ on which Fallingwater is built. Most
intriguing is the fact that, although today we
hail Frank Lloyd Wright as one of the giants of
American architecture, when he was comrnis-
sioned by Kaufmann to build the “waterfall cot-
tage,” he was generally regarded as past his
prime, and was coming out of a 12-year dry

building.

Kaufmarm hailed from a family who, upon
moving to America, peddled goods in. south-
western Pennsylvania. Through a series of coin-
cidences, he and his wife, Liliane, ended up
running the family department store in
Pittsburgh. When that business took off, he built
new branches everywhere, often employing the
classical architecture Wright detested. It seems
strange, then, that Kaufmann would commis-
sion Wright to build him a modern masterpiece
like Fallingwater in the woods of Bear Run, but
Toker explains it to us this way: “We could
think of Kaufmann’s education in _modern
architecture as a class that covered two semes-
ters: the 1920s exposed him to modemistic, and
the 1930s to more radical modernism.”

Wright, for his part, desperately needed the
job Kaufmann hired him for. The Great
Depression had hit. him hard. He had expensive
tastes and no clients. Although he conducted a
school. for architecture at his home in
Wisconsin, which Kaufmann’s son attended, it
wasn’t really a proﬁtable enterprise. Ever the
sharp se1f—promoter, he sent Kaufmann a book
detailing his work and had his secretary, A.

Going away from home for Homecoming celebrations

It’s homecoming week, and that
means that there are oodles of Pitt
traditions to participate in. Well, at
least there were four years ago,
when we had ,a stadium on cam- e
was synonymous with the Pitt
football tradition. Alas, now we have
to .truck it to the North Side to see
the game and homecoming proces-
sion. _

But what if we weren’t a school
with deep football roots? What if we

were, say, Kent State or Edinboro?
Would we still celebrate homecoming

, with such enthusiasm? Or would their

homecomings still kick our homecom-

ing’s butt? - ,-

. In the fall of .2001, the party at Kent State
started Friday night and gave students and alum-

. ni little chance to recuperate -— they woke up

bright and early'Saturday morning for kegs and
eggs. At 7 a.m. in a particular frat house, the
brothers who were awake were pumped up and
ready to go, and making so much noise that the
rest of the house had no choice but to rise and
shine. It’s very seldom that I get excited about
taking a 7 a.m. shower in a frat house while I’m
hung over. ,‘ '

At 8 a.m., the homecoming parade began its

march down Main Street. Since a few frat hous-

  
 
 
 
    

Katie -Mavrich

es call Main Street. ‘home, they

provided the perfect vantage

point for the ﬂoats, mascots and
Kent State’s own Zamboni. Better
than the view was the fact that we
never had to stray far from the
beer. ,

Parents, alumni and .a random
shirtless—shoeless guy with crazy
hair kept the party going. Despite
the chilly weather, the grills. were
fired up like it was the Fourth of
July. No hurrying off to the game,
though —— it was more like an extend-
ed pre—game until the night’s concert,
played in the past by Godsmack,
Parliament and other national acts.

Back ‘in our own state, Edinboro’s celebra-
tion during the. weekend of Oct. 3 actually
kicked off on\Wednesday, Oct. 1, this year, and
that’s when some of my friends from high school
drove up to catch the bonfire. By the time I got
there on Friday, things had not died down at all.
Parents and alumni, along with students and
friends, crowded the small town’s bars. At the
Hotel Bar, beer was served in cans, because large
amounts of drunk people and glass bottles don’t
exactly mix well.

Fast forward to Saturday morning. The
natives were getting a bit restless by 10 a.m.
While the extra three hours of sleep were wel-

comed, there was still a rush to get out among
the celebrations. A hearty breakfast at Perkins
provided the perfect base for the cheap beer con-
sumed during the parade. Even the high school
in Edinboro got involved — their marching band
and cheerleaders braved the frigid fall weather in
the name of school spirit. Between the bands and
convertibles, Greeks competed against each
other for the best ﬂoat. Again, no one here wor-
ried about football, yet homecoming is a tradi-
tion deeply rooted in their alma mater.

Pitt has a kick-ass football team and a few
traditions of its own. We have school-sponsored
activities, but it just doesn’t seem like everyone
takes advantage of them. Yeah, there are tons of
us tailgating before the game and talking smack
on the other team’s fans, but what about those
who couldn’t care less about football? Are they
camped out on their dilapidated South Oakland
porches, catching up with friends from home?
Do they attend our homecoming bonfire? Do
their friends drive from miles away for Pitt
Homecoming? It’s doubtful.

While celebrating our ingrained traditions,
we should make a few of our own. We should not
only celebrate our football team, we should also
celebrate our alumni, parents and friends.
Because without them, homecoming wouldn’t be
what it is.

Just one piece of advice — don’t vote a dork
for king.

Bubble- gum pop princess has revamped herself into 'a_ “dirrty” girl

It’s been two years since the
nude—colored clothing stripper and
“cry me a river” gal came outwith her
last album. Just when you think
you’ve heard her sing, “I’m a Slave
for_You” for the final time, the regret-
tably coined phrase comes back:
“Oops, She did it, again.”

What is it about Britney Spears
that allows her to come back from a
vacation from touring and MTV after
a year-and—a-half? Is she really that
talented? Does she have the best voice
in the world? (Two words: Christina
Aguilera.) Does she have what it
takes to overcome critics’ reviews and
deliver a best-selling album? Will she
be able to bring back her half—there
wardrobe and hair extensions for a
second time around?

The question needs to be asked:
How is Spears going to be able to
come back after her controversial bro-
ken relationship with Justin
Timberlake, which the tabloids didn’t
exactly use to paint the pop princess
as all that innocent?

For example: Fred Durst on
Howard Stern, Timberlake on a radio
show explicitly stating the depths of

     

their relationship, and her “beverage-

consuming” nights out at dance clubs.
What’s the girl got to do I

now to get back‘ to being
that girl» in the Catholic
schoolgirl uniform with
pink pom-poms in her hair
— let’s hope we never see
that fashion statement,
again, unless we see
MADTV imitate it." She’s
come a long way with her
tiny, ‘tiny boy—cut shorts
barely ' covering her
cheeks and blonde exten-
sions hiding another part
of her body, though.
Please, just check ioutithe

    

Ash|eMire

 

How does that happen? How does
a person go from idolizing the unat-
tainable to sharing saliva
with her? I guess I should
reconsider my attempts to
meet my role model. After
all, if a little smooch is all
it takes to be their best
friend, I’m set. But maybe
Madonna sees a “ray of
light” in Spears. .

/ Don’t get me wrong,
though. Not to be a hyp-
ocrite, but the girl rocks.
You have to agree, she’s a
great entertainer. You’ve
all wished — at least once
— that you could mimic

pages in Esquire for more
information. , , —

Perhaps she’ll overcome these
rumors by coming backfromvher hia-
tus with a lip-to-lip encounter.‘ with
Madonna at the MTV Video Music
Awards. That’s always a good way to
get back in the media’s blinding spot-
light. Nothing like a ‘little Lip
Smackers lip-locking fest between the
queen and princess of pop. Way to go.
Your parents should be proud.

 

her moves to get that hottie
at a party to drop his or her plastic,
red cup and rush over to dance with
you. She epitomizes sexiness,
whether we want to admit it or not.
We’ve all secretly wished for a
glimpse inside her wardrobe.
However, if you were to sneak a peek
after Spears’ hiatus, you may discover
it empty, save for a few pairs of
panties. After all, the covers of
Rolling Stone and Esquire provide

.ittnews.com

examples of this. Photographed in
practically nothing, this may be
Spears’ attempt to save money by not
spending her millions on covering
herself up.

Believe it or not, though, I am a
fan —- not a fan of seeing her naked,
but of the fact that the girl knows how
to show her audience that it’s okay to
be a strong and independent woman.
In these regards, I, along with every
other teen magazine, consider her an
icon.‘ She’s shown us that you can
pick up the pieces of a broken heart
and rise to the top.

The breakup with Timberlake was
the end of one of the most controver-
sial relationships within the past cou-
ple of_ years among Hollywood cou-
ples. Still, with all the rumors, Spears
bounced back and is ready to wow
audiences for a second time.

Who knows what tactic Spears is
going to use to gain back audiences’
approval? Has she matured, though?
Perhaps coming back with a more
tasteful look? Only early November
will tell with the launch of her latest
CD. “Dirty Pop” just may take on a
whole new meaning.

Jensen went so far to entice Kaufmann
as to have him placed on ajury judging

and businessmen in America.

When Wright accepted Kaufmann’s
commission to build a “weekend

more than just a client. Kaufmann was

Senior guard J aron Brown goes up for a layu during a
game last season against Notre Dame. Brown and the

Panthers hit the ﬂoor.Friday night at Midnight Madness.

Men’s team

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

Laughter engulfed the Petersen Events

Center during Midnight Madness on Friday’
. night, when Carl Krauser hit a layup in the 10-

minute exhibition game.

_ Krauser controlled a rebound under the bas-
ket, and threw the ball under his leg, around his
back, and casually put the ball in for two points
to the delight of the crowd. » ‘

e‘‘This is really [an event] for the kids and
for the fans,” head coach Jamie Dixon said.

During the 10 minutes of exhibition play
between the Gold and Blue teams, Panther fans
saw the type of plays that one would expect to
see on the blacktop courts of New York.

The Panthers tried several alley-oops and
other standout plays to excite the fans. It is an
event made for the fans, in an attempt to get
them excited for the upcoming season, and the
Panthers did just that. .

The exhibition game had highlights .that

electrified the crowd, especially when the new

   dazzles
crowd with style of play  

faces got into the game. Freshmen forwards
Dante Milligan and Ed Turner both hit three
pointers‘ and Milligan later won the three—point
contest, hitting five buckets.

Chevon Troutman was the standout in the
slam dunk contest, in which he threw the ball
up, took off his jersey, grabbed the ball on the
bounce, and dunked it. Even though T routman’s
one dunk stood out, forward Mark McCarroll
won the contest outright with three solid dunks.

“It’s basically just a fun event,” Jaron
Brown said. “We get serious tomorrow.”

The new-look Panthers had not held a prac-
tice before the events on Friday. Their first
practice of the season was on Saturday, where
they started scheming for the upcoming season.

The Panthers are looking at a lot of new
faces at several positions on the court, but they
are hoping for the same results. Dixon said that
they would adjust schematically to the strengths
of their players. I

Panthers prepare for Big Eastrival Syracuse

RYAN WALKER
Staff Writer

Walt I-Iarris is still waiting_ for
his team to improve on the minor
details of the game, which he feels

' are the reasons that the Pitt football

team is‘ not performing at its ‘full
potential.’ V ’ *

“We’re capable of playing a lot ;

better,” Harris; said.‘ “I know our
football players are going to make a

better effort to try to get all the -little V

details, and We’re going to do a bet-
ter job of makingit more clear, so
there is no area where we slip up.” ,

As Pitt gets set_to take on a '

physical Syracuse team this week-
end, the emphasis will be on
improving the blocking, particularly
the run blocking. , -
“We need to improve on the

‘ details iandvrun the ball to have a

chance against [Syracuse],” Harris
said. I
Offensive tackle Rob Petitti and

H, Harris, both said that the problem

with blocking is not that’_the whole

offensive unit is breaking down, but

2,000 yards over the

that it is one"”player getting beat or
missing an assignment that is caus-

_ ing the problem. '

“It seems like there is. always
one guy missing his block on each

,play,” Petitti said. “When we get

that taken care of, when ‘we are
blocking all 11 guys at a time, we’ll
be‘ able] to start running the ball.’’ _

The Panthers” coaching staff has
been receiving" criticism for their

halftime’ adjustments. But Harris

felt that adjustments were not the
problem’ in the second half against
Rutgers this past weekend. He said
that Pitt got conservative with its
play calling, while Rutgers came
into the second half with nothing to
lose. .

-“[Rutgers] was-way behind, so
they threw caution to the wind,”
Harris said. “We were much more
cautious, so we lost some of our
aggressiveness. We’ll» be
We’ve just got to get better, and our
players have got to want to get bet-
ter. We’re not that far away.” ,

Pitt’s defense has given up over

games. While those numbers may be
startling to some, Harris finds that
worrying about the statistics is
counterproductive, and said that his
focus is on improving. .

This week, Harris will look t
improve the defense by going back
to the basics and focusing on the
details. He believes that the defense
has good schemes, coaches, and
players, but might have been think-
ing they were a little better than
they actually are. ‘

“I don’t know if we paid atten-
tion to the details as much, and it
[has] haunted, us,” Harris said.
“Now I would think that our players
know that if you’re really focused,
and really trying and working on
trying to’ play like you practice, we
can do it. If you don’t, we’ll strug-
gle.”

Another struggle the Panthers
have faced lately has been their
field goal "kicking. Last season
place-kicker David Abdul was a

freshman All-American, but this

year has not been nearly as accurate.
Abdul has only made‘ 40 percent of

:.’x:5..-‘.“.»=.‘.Jw." -In :,'.~i._3..-I 1. -am. ,.

his field goal attempts this season
and has missed all four of his kicks
over the past two games. Despite
Abdul’s recent lack of production,
Harris says that he has not given up
on his kicker. .

“We believe in David [Abdul].
We thought David kicked the ball
better this past game than he did
versus Notre Dame,” Harris said

“We shortened the field goals a little *

bit so it wouldn’t be a strain, and
now he’s got to get it done. He’s got
to do the technique that has proven
for him to be successful. If he does-
n’t, then the chances of being suc-
cessful aren’t very good.”

Harris added that there is a

chance backup place-kicker. J.B.
Gibboney may see some action if

Abdul is not hitting the ball like

Harris knows that he can.

The Panthers come home this
weekend and will square off against
the Syracuse Orangemen.

“We’re good enough to get it
done, “Harris said. “We’re -just
going to have to be more physical
this week.” i

Donruss sellsRuth’s jersey
strips with baseball cards

SPORTS 

 

George Steinbrenner’s Evil Empire
minions are playing in the Fall Classic
once’ again. But with a travel break in
the World Series on Monday, it wasn’t
Jason Giambi or Derek Jeter making
headlines for the Yankees.

It was Babe Ruth.

Baseball card company Donruss,
which purchased an authentic 1925
Ruth pinstripe jersey last year at an auc-
tion for $264,210, proceeded to cut the

jersey yesterday, so that one-by-one’

inch slices of the garment could be ran-
domly placed in baseball card packs.

The jersey is believed to be one of
only three Ruth pinstripes in existence,
but according to ESPN.com, that does-
n’t make much difference to Dom'uss
president Bill Dully.

“There’s always going to be contro-
versy,” Dully said. “But something like

  
  

this is just the reality of the free market
and the reality of capitalism.”

And the reality of a world gone
money crazy.

As someone who has worked at a
museum and cares about historic
preservation, I ﬁnd this decision by
Donruss completely outrageous. That
jersey’s historic value is priceless, and
chances are that, if it had been profes-
sionally appraised, its value would have
been more than $264,210.

It should have been donated to a
museum, cataloged, and displayed for
generations of baseball fans and histori-
ans to enjoy. Instead, it has been
destroyed and can never be regained,
and for what? A promotional scheme to
sell baseball cards.

The value of baseball cards has
steadily dropped since the early ‘90s.
High prices for packs, increased pro-
duction costs, and a huge drop in the
popularity of baseball have all been
contributing factors. -Baseball card
companies have scrambled to try and
recoup the losses, delving into other
sports memorabilia markets, such as

DAVID SHEAROUSE
Staff Writer

The front cover of the 2003-04 -

Pitt Women’s Basketball Media
Guide says everything you need to
know about this year’s team ——
Pitt’s new head coach Agnus
Berenato brings a new attitude.

The front cover features seniors
Latoya Kincaid, Sheila Stufﬂet, and
Stacy Moore with Berenato posed
in an intimidating fashion with
arms crossed and eyes narrowed.
While this ‘year’s lineup may not
compare with past teams as far as
experience is concerned, Berenato
is excited about the scrapp‘iness of
her squad. ‘

“We’ll work‘ hard,” Berenato
said. “We’ll leave it all on the
court.”

Berenato stressed that her team
would play a style of basketball that
emphasized the fast break and fea-
tured a hard-nosed defense.

Junior guard Amy Kunich is the
Panthers only returning starter from
last season. Kunich averaged 6.9
points per game and 3.9 assists per
game last year at point guard. A

“Somebody is going to have to
fill a lot of minutes,” Berenato said.

Competing for those minutes

  ma, 

will be senior co-captains Kincaid,

Stufflet, and Moore. In addition to

returning junior Allisha Morris,
sophomores Jessica Allen, Shavon
Earp, Katie Histed, Bridget Larkin,
and Cheron Taylor will also be in
the mix. Berenato is also enthusias-
tic about the freshman class, which

includes Jennifer Brown, Aieshya , 1

Dixon, Brooke and
Danielle Taylor.
“[Brown] really has a bright

future ahead of her,” Berenato said.

Hughes,

‘‘All the freshmen are a great group -

of young ladies.”

Kincaid was also impressed
with the freshman class.

“All the freshmen are very tal-
ented,” Kincaid said. ‘ ‘‘They’re
going to add a lot to our game.”

Pitt started its season Saturday‘

morning with a series of 20-minute
scrimmages following the conclu-
sion of -its annual Midnight

Madness festivities. At the festivi-

ties, the women’s Gold team defeat-
ed the women’s Blue team 8-6.
Afterward," Hughes teamed up
with fellow freshmen Dante
Milligan of the Men’s basketball
team to win the three-point contest
with a combined score of 13 three-

status as a top-ranked program in
the country, and he has the challeng-
ing schedule to prove it. Dixon said
this year’s schedule is the toughest
schedule they’ve had in his five
years at Pitt.

The‘ Panthers will play three
non—conference teams whose bas-
ketball programs have been among
the best. Two of those teams,
Florida State and Georgia, will

come to Pitt to play late in
December.

The third is Alabama, whom
they will play in the very first game
of the season in the Coaches vs.
Cancer Classic. The game will be
playedat Madison Square Garden,
where Dixon says they like to play.
That is why they could not turn
down the opportunity to open the
season there against a very good
opponent. . , A

Dixon also highlighted several

key Big East games that they have
on the schedule, such as Syracuse,
Notre Dame, and Connecticut, all of
whom the Panthers will play twice.

“Our guys are ready for the
challenge,” Dixon said.

Dixon feels confident that Pitt
can continue its success at home.
Pitt is 16-0 when playing at the
Pete. 0

‘‘We’ve got the best home court
in the Big East, and probably in the
country,” Dixon said.

years from now, that pinstripe jersey
that Donruss bought and out like it was
a’thrift—store purchase would have been
as valuable to a museum as one of
Ulysses S. Grant’s Civil War uniforms
are now. ‘

And where will the trend stop?
Why don’t we just cut up a Dwight
Eisenhower uniform‘ and put it in
“Saving Private Ryan” DVDs. Or saw
apart the Mona Lisa and put it up on
eBay.

Major League Baseball is a game
that embraces its history, and in the last
three years, it’s seen one of its greatest
superstars get cryogenically frozen by

his greedy stepson, and another have
his jersey posthumously trimmed.

While the Ted Williams freezing
situation was out of Major League
Baseball’s hands, the Ruth jersey con-
troversy was not. Baseball should have
stepped up and purchased Ruth’s jersey
before the slime balls at Donruss did.

Then it would be in a museum right
now instead of in a factory next to a
Rob Mackowiak glossy.

While Berenato hopes to win,
several games this year, she also
has several off—court goals, as well.

op a winning attitude,” Berenato
said. “How you walk, how you
dress, and how you prepare are all
keys to success.” ,

“This is not a sprint. This is a.
marathon, and we’re in this for

ketball. V
