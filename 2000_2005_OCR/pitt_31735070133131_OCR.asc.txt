the parties are winding down —— time to

5 Students frequently. wander the
streets of Oakland during early mom-

in the area, local police think students
might want to be more concerned about
their safety. ‘ -

v“Although no students have been
involved in the recent shootings [in
Oakland], they should‘ still ’ exercise
precaution,” Zone 4 Sergeant Benjamin
Bogus said. “And stay with people you

Bogus referred to several shootings
that have occurred near Pitt’s campus
in the past few months. According to

“I hear a lot of good students in
my class talk about how they’re
afraid they won’t get into Pitt,” said
Dominic Berardinelli, a Pitt appli-

The University credits the qual-

major factor in the increase in top-

according to Ore.

"wonder if they could get into Pitt

Jennifer’ Dietrich, an incoming
freshman, was in the top 10 percent
of her class of more than 600 stu-

She chose Pitt’s engineering
school as her No. 1 choice because
of Pitt’s urban setting and many
available options.

Pitt’s Medical Center also pro-

After the laun_ch of Sputnik, the

Though the competition
between Russia and the United
States has died- down, the National
Resource Centers have survived,

providing students with comprehen-

sive knowledge and understanding
of other cultures,‘ according to Dr;
William Brustein, director of the
University Center for International

Every third year, colleges that
house the National Resource
Centers are reevaluated by the U.S.
Department of Education. to deter-
mine if the schools are still worthy
of funding. ,

Universities throughout the
country are constantly updating
their Centers for International
Studies, so there is tough competi-
tion to retain the status.

“You aren’t al-ways redesignat—
ed,” Brustein said. “Some schools

get knocked out. Each time, it gets ,0

tougher and tougher.”

After nearly two decades ‘of
national funding, the U.S.
Department of Education again

COURTESY BERNHARDT LIEBERMAN

Professor emeritus Bernhardt Lieberman used his own money to begin conducting .
research on hackers when he felt there was not enough reliable information about them

Study gets hackers to open up

Staff Writer

ered, Lieberman has learned that
they are neither as “weird” as the

They are pasty white from lack - hackers in the movie, “Hackers,”

of outside contact. They have weird
hairstyles and no girlfriends, and
they will bring about the end of the
world, with malicious intent,
through computers.

This might sound like the
description of a typical computer
hacker, but it’s not true, according
to Bernhardt Lieberman, a professor
emeritus of sociology at Pitt.

Lieberman has studied hackers
since 1990, and in August, he com-
pleted his memorandum on them.
His findings indicate that hackers
are not so different from anyone
else, except that they might commit

a crime daily by hacking into com~ v

puters.

Lieberman interviewed fourteen
hackers in western Pennsylvania
and gave them five questionnaires,
ranging from one rating their atti-
tudes toward the law, to another
about their social interactions.

He also attended a professional
meeting of hackers, where he inter-
viewed and questioned 28 hackers. '

Lieberman says there are two
actual definitions of hackers. A
hacker is either someone who does
“elegant” programming” on comput-
ers and is considered positive in the
public’s eyes, or a hacker is some-
one who intrudes upon .another’s
computer and is viewed as one who
does harm.

From the information he gath-

nor as destructive as the hacker in
“War Games.”

According to the responses to
his “Motivation of Hackers” ques-
tionnaire, hackers’ highest—rated
motivations. are “intellectual chal-
lenge” and to “learn about comput-
ers and computing.”

Their lowest—rated motivations
are “to break the law” and “to get to
be known,” according to the results.

The findings are contrary to the
image projected by popular books
and movies about hackers,
Lieberman said, adding that their
actions are often associated, in pop-
ular thought, with the idea of having
“an informal social system that is
omnipotent.” He said others stereo-
type hackers as possessing the abil-
_ity to instigate World War III.

But hackers’ intentions are not

malevolent, Lieberman said, though
he does believe they can cause great
harm. Lieberman’s study allowed
hackers to speak for themselves.

“A hacker is someone who
understands technology, so they can
make it do anything they want it to
do,” one hacker is quoted as saying
in Lieberman’s memorandum.

the hacker sound as if he is both
destructive and seeking_omnipo-

CWO tackles abortion, emergency

familiar with the organization.

This year, however, the group
skipped the march in favor of a con-
cert, which Stephan said she thought
might be more inclusive. The
evening also included a self—defense

workshop, a poetry reading and a‘

“speak out” where sexual assault
victims shared their stories.
Stephan said she was pleased

_with the event, which drew more

men than ever before, but added
that, in the spring, the group will
probably revive the march — this
time as a silent, candlelight event.
The organization is also
involved in other events throughout
the year, including a production of
the Eve Ensler play “The Vagina
Monologues,” the National Young
Women’s Day of Action, and a
December drive for clothing, toi-
letries and other necessities for the
Greater Pittsburgh Women’s Shelter.

But the group does more than.

organize events.

A few,years ago, the group led a
fight to bring emergency contracep-
tion — otherwise known as “the
morning-after pill” because it
reduces the risk o_f pregnancy when
taken within 72 hours of unprotected
sex — to the Stude_nt_ Health Center
at Pitt. ’

After more than two years of stu-
dent lobbying, Pitt revised the
school’s policy on prescribing emer-
gency contraception in June, 2001,
so that students would have less

_ trouble getting prescriptions, as they

reported having before the revisions.
' Pitt was the first university to
offer the medicine at the school’s
Student Health Center, according to
Stephan. -

CWO also takes a stance on
women’s freedom to choose about

abortion, though Stephan said the»
group is more interested in “the per-

sonal side” than the politics sur-

rounding the issue.

“We’re also a very strong pro-
choice voice for women on campus,”
Stephan said, adding that the group
works to spread information about
the health and education needs of
non-students.

“I don’t think people really see
the connection between access to

‘reproductive health and access to

education,” Stephan said.

The need for an organized pro-
choice voice isparticularly strong in
Pennsylvania, Stephan said, describ-
ing the state as pretty conservative.
She said she’ knew women at
Pennsylvania State University, in
central Pennsylvania, who traveled
to Pittsburgh for abortions because

of the lack of clinics in their area.

“We’re notphere to judge or do
anythingelse,” she said. “We’re here
to help.”

‘While the group tackles many
difficult issues, members also enjoy
getting together once a month to
watch episodes of HBO’s “Sex in the
City.” The group also holds regular
movie nights.

Last year, in response of a calen-
dar of attractive Pitt women put out
by the Society for the Finer Things,
CWO sponsored the 2003 Finer-er
Things male calendar.

The calendar featured “guys pos-
ing that wouldn’t normally be in a
calendar,” according to then—secre-
tary of CWO and calendar model
Brett Wiewiora.

CWO plans to produce a 2004

Finer-er Things calendar, Stephan’

Said.
There is room in the club for all
men," she added— even, it seems,

those who don’t want to bare their

bodies in the pages of a satirical cal-
endan -

“We definitely have space for
males,” Stephan said.

CWO is accepting applicants for
positions as Members at Large
through this Friday, she added

Officer ‘said he fears more layoffs

Police, page 1

According to Tammy Ewin, a city
police spokesperson, “The strength in
each zone has not decreased much, in
terms of police ofﬁcers patrolling the
streets.”

But Bogus suggested that the
_changes might have greater effects to
the police force itself.

“Because layoffs were done by
seniority, the [officers] that were laid
off were the youngest, strongest and

l

urzeﬁivuéd-91.:-ul-1Is'V£‘¢l-an

most aggressive officers we -had,”
Bogus said, “We need officers with that
kind of determined drive out patrolling
our streets.” T ' '

After the layoffs, the department
decided to put onto patrol some of the
officers who had been doing desk work
at the station.

Bogus is also worried about future
layoffsl . '

“The city won’t say that they won’t
lay off any more policemen, because it
may happen,” Bogus said. '

Hackers enjoy beauty, artistic. potential of computers, Pitt professor emeritus said

Hackers, page 3

cate that hackers don’t generally
seek power for negative results.

In the “Belief in the Hacker
Ethic” questionnaire, the responses
“you can create art and beauty on a
computer” -and “computers can
change life for the better” rated as
some of the most frequently chosen
among the hackers. '

There exists, however, some

. discrepancy between what hackers
do and their beliefs. In the ethics
questionnaire, only 7 percent
agreed with the statement “privacy
is not important to me.”

Lieberman pointed out that
hackers do not extend that belief to
those whose computers they hack.

Also, on the “attitude toward
the law” scale, hackers had a mod-
erately high attitude toward the
law, even though they “repeatedly
break the law,” according to
Lieberman. .

Perhaps the statements that
most defied the hacker stereotype
were the highly agreed upon “I find
it e-asy to relax with other people”
and “I don’t mind talking to people
at parties or social gatherings.”

Hackers responded to these on
the “Social Anxiety and Social
Avoidance” questionnaire,‘ and
these answers defy what Lieberman
described as the mass media image
of. hackers as “incapable of normal
social interactions.” _

Another misconception, that
hackers, have “undeveloped sex
lives,” is not true either, Lieberman
said. Many of the hackers he inter-
viewed said they have girlfriends
and have sexual experiences with
them.

,The idea that hackers are
‘almost always male does seem to
be true. Even though the hackers

Lieberman interviewed varied in,

race and’ age, none were female.
\ Lieberman said that, of the
2,000 hackers who attended the

«‘ '§'£'"§s*«'' "

i 687-777 ( Pick up and Catering) 
% 421-9346 (For Deliver )  A

professional meeting, between 5
and 10 percent were female — and
he was told that most women there
were accompanying a male partner.

Lieberman’s fascination with
the potentially harmful hackers
began developing in 1986, when he
wanted to know more about people
who put in “hours and hours”,of
work hacking each day without any
monetary reward.

The National Science
Foundation refused to fund him, as
did federal, state, private and cor-
porate organizations, he ‘said.

“I got 50 to 75 rejection let-
ters,” Lieberman said. “No one was

interested.”

Lieberman eventually took it
upon himself to finance his
research.

“We have very little reliable
information about the tens of thou-
sands, perhaps hundreds ‘of thou-
sands, of hackers who live and work
in the United States and all over the
world,” Lieberman said.

“I’ve spent my life satisfying
my curiosity,” said Lieberman, who
earned his degree at Boston
University in 1958.

His other studies have included
college students who cheat on their
lovers and the politics behind infor-

mation on second—hand smoke.

Lieberman opened an invitation
to those at Pitt interested in hearing
him lecture on his research on hack-
ers — a subject little understood
until now.

FBI should not give money to terrorists

Budgeting is difficult to begin
with, but budgeting the federal gov-
ernment is downright thorny.‘ For
example, money needs to be allocat-
ed for education, $400 hammers and
terrorism.

, That’s right, terrorism. The
Associated Press reported on Oct. 7

that during the Clinton administra— I

tion, the FBI had sent “several thou-
sand dollars in U.S. money  to
suspected terror supporters” in the

hopes of tracking their cash flow and ‘

linking it to terrorist actions.

No prosecutions resulted from
the undercover sting, based out of
Phoenix, Ariz., which gave money to
the Islamic Resistance Movement,
also known as Hamas, a Palestinian
militant group. In fact, the operation
stopped abruptly when the FBI’s
main contact, Arizona businessman
Harry Ellen, had an affair with a
woman suspected of espionage.

The operation, at first, just
seems like an asinine waste of
money. Why give money to a group
that already claims culpability for
terrorist attacks? And if that money
were used, what would the FBI then
do? ‘

Tracking money is a good way
of fighting crime. Give marked
money to drug traffickers and see
where it goes. Track its circulation
on U.S. soil, and they can be prose-

cuted for white—co1lar crimes, -if they
can’t be held for possession or deal-
ing. \ '
But funding terrorist groups
leads to terrorist actions. Even if the
operation was ineffective, who
knows where the money went? Not
the FBI, apparently.

And, moreover, not informing
Clinton’s national security adviser
of these actions_ is rather suspicious.
While former Attorney General
Janet Reno signed off on ‘them,
Sandy Berger, Clinton’s security
adviser, denies knowledge of this.

The blame then falls to the FBI,
and not the Clinton Administration,
which, at the time, was trying to
negotiate peace between Israelis and
Palestinians.

Obviously, in the interests of
national security, the FBI couldn’t
have made its sting public. But
shouldn’t it, and other executive
branch organizations, be held
accountable to the other parts of the
government? The higher—ups should
have known about the FBI’s use ‘—
or misuse —— of money.

In order to infiltrate terrorist
organizations, the United States
funded one. This places the blame,
and whatever blood was shed as a
result of this funding, squarely on
the United States. Suddenly, those
$400 hammers don’t seem so costly.

Changes: not just for.Oreos, Pitt, couches

“You need to come over and see our
new place,” my friend Melissa announced
in between bites of her Campus Deli chick-
en cheesesteak Crap, I thought. My close
friend moved, and I had no idea; I knew I
sho11ld read her away messages more care-
fully. Before I ﬁgured out how I missed
such an event, she continued.

“We got new Slipcovers for our couch-
es. They look great.” My ﬁrst reaction was
to ‘rip on Melissa for implying Slipcovers
qualiﬁed as an entirely new South Oakland
apartment, but at the time, my mouth was
ﬁlled with french fries. Fortunately, this
pause allowed me a moment
of enlightenment regarding
the value of slight,‘but signif-
icant, change. ’ ;

People shouldn’t start
shopping for their winter
wardrobes in the slipcover
section of Linens ‘n Things.
Yet the‘ power of a minor
makeover shouldn’t be
underestimated. It’s a simple
formula: A slight, A physical
alteration with monumental"
results. . ,

Billy Joel’s hit, “Just the
Way You Are” has spent years in my CD
player set on repeat The words, “don’t go
changing to try and please me . . . I love you

just the way you are,” tempt my dominant I

lazy side. But, even without too much
effort, change can produce unexpected ben-
eﬁts. V ‘ :
According to the Society for Sports
Unifonns Research Web site, in the
National Football League, there’s a correla-
tion between new uniforms and teams
reaching ‘the playoffs. During playoﬁs of
the 1996 through 2000 seasons, at least one
of the postseason teams was sporting new
jerseys. In 1997, 1999 and 2000, one of the
newly uniformed teams played in the Super
Bowl. ’ --

complete transformation? Thanks to
Clairol’s Natural Instincts semi—permanent
hair color, my roomrnate’s hair is a shade
darker this week than it was last week. For
less than ten dollars and a half-hour’s time,

I she’s a self—described new person. The next

night she attended a party as her new self,
and-returned with stories of great conversa-

tion and fun with attractive guys.

Coincidence? Heck, no. Change.

Of course, certain things should remain
unchanged. Dave & Andy’s Birthday Cake
ﬂavored ice. cream is perfection in 
form. Fyodor Dostoevsky’s “Crime and
' ‘Punishme'nt” and Ann Martin’s

“Baby-Sitters Club” series are
literary masterpieces, no change
needed. 1‘
But even when some-
' thing boasts ﬂawlessness, it
may still beneﬁt from change.
Take, for example, Oreos. The
yummy -black and white cook-
ies have been eaten by the _bag
for decades. But they didn’t go
from just really popular to
insanely desirable by standing
still. Much of the Oreo success
can be attributed to the dozens
of varieties and tspin—oiTs: Double Stuf,
reduced fat, holiday variety, Oreo Os cereal
and so on.

Even Pitt is aware of the slight change ’

phenomenon. This year alone, awnings
along Forbes Avenue and grass patches near
Posvar Hall have been added to improve
our campus’ aesthetic appeal. Certainly, the
alterations in appearance can be considered
minor, but don’t'be surprised if Pitt is soon
referred to as the Ivy of Oakland.

So perhaps Sombrero Man hasn’t been

asking for anything? with  consistent"

“change-change” mantra. He was offering
invaluable advice. ‘

Maria believes change isn’t just for under- 0‘

wear. anymore. ’She can be reached at

THE PITT NEWS

Wednesday, October 8, 2003

If you speak your mind, should you lose your job?

I’m not one to pass up a free speech
discussion, and last week’s Rush
Limbaugh debacle certainly ﬁts the cri-
teria for one. The incident isn’t terribly
weighty in itself; just something for peo-
ple to get up in arms about this month.
But it’s interesting for me because it
demonstrates one way in which lan-
guage is used to push and enforce ide-
ologies.

For those who may have missed out
on the controversy, Limbaugh’s state-
ment, made in reference to Philadelphia
Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb,
goes like this: “[McNabb is] overrated
 The media has been very desirous that
a black quarterback can do well —— black
coaches and black quarterbacks doing
well. There’s a little hope invested in
McNabb, and he got a lot of credit for
the performance of his team that he did-

n’t deserve. The defense carried this

team.” _

Roughly translated,’Limbaugh was
saying that McNabb made magazine
covers while the defense made plays.
His assertion that McNabb has been
hyped up by a “socially concerned”
media is a supportable argument. In fact,
S1ate’s Allen Barra did so in detail on
Thursday, posting a column that makes
the argument while citing’ all kinds of
Eagles stats.

For instance, since McNabb became
the starter for Philadelphia in 2000, the

Advancement of Colored

Eagles offense has never been ranked

higher than 10th in the league in yards“

gained. The defense, on the other hand,
has never been ranked lower than 10th
in least yards allowed. Barra goes on at
length, but I will leave the statistical
stuff to’ him. V.
What concerns me most is just how
easily a man can lose a job for stating an
opinion. Limbaugh’s remarks received
no backlash for about two days —ah1'S
colleagues at ESPN didn’t even 
twice about them before the V
criticism started pouring in.
But then it was open season.
Everyone from the National
Association for the I

People to publicity-hungry
Democratic presidential can- W
didates gathered their pitch-
forks and torches, and cried,-‘_—
“Resign!” from the rooftops-,7

Did theylactually think
about Limbaugh’s point or do
any investigating of their,-‘own? It cer-
tainly doesn’t look that way. They sim-
ply heard a conservative commentator
talking, about a black man and loaded
the bandwagon with crusaders.

The same thing happened to Trent
Lott last year. While speaking at Strom
Thurmond’s 100th birthday party, he
told the elderly senator that the country

would have been better off if he had-

  

Eric Miller

Columnist

been elected president in 1948. Granted,
that was a different case with more his-
tory. _
Back then, part of Thurmond’s plat-
form included segregation, and Lott
took _a similar stance as a fraternity
brother in college.

But as I. re-read these candid, cor-
dial praises that he offered to an old man
on his birthday, which make no overt
mention of anything racial, I hardly get
the impression that they are innuendoes
from a devoted bigot. It
seems more like Lott’s
enemies found a spin
opportunity that was too
good to pass up. i

Charlton Heston is
another man who knows
something about criticism.
 ’ Despite dedicating time

and money to the civil
rights movement long
before it got a popular
endorsement, Heston has

-. taken ﬁre from all sides, most recently

receiving it from Michael Moore’s mis-
leading, Academy.Award-winning docu-
mentary, “Bowling for Columbine.” In a
speech he delivered at Harvard’ in
February 1999, Heston identiﬁes such
speech policing as the opposition in a
“cultural war.”

He states: “If you talk about race, it

‘does not make you a racist. If ‘you see

distinctions between the genders, it does
not make you a sexist. If you think crit-
ically about a denomination, _it does not
make you anti-religion. If you accept
but don’t celebrate homosexuality, it
does not make you a homophobe.”

I highly doubt that Rush Limbaugh
will ﬁnd himself in an unemployment
line any time soon. He has plenty of fall-
backs behind his on—the—side — ESPN
career. But events like this set a prece-
dent that is applicable at all levels — if
you break this established social code, if
you speak your mind in such away that

can be interpreted or twisted to be insen-
sitive or offensive, your whole lifecan _

be stripped from you. _
This cultural war has offenders on
both sides. Speak out on patriotism the

wrong way and the Right will brand you

an America-hater. But I ﬁnd that most of
the speech police reside on the Left,
lunging at and destroying anyone who
violates the etiquette of their social
agenda. We enjoy a high degree of ‘free

speech in this country, but something’s‘

wrong when critiquing the media makes
one a racist and a birthday wish can cost
a man his life’s work.

Eric Miller expects his supporters and
critics to speak freely, and he promises
not to use your comments to dismantle
your life. Contact him at saveI01 @hot—
mail. com. I ’ A

Don’t prosecute the ice cream-truck man, you old sourpusses

A disturbing menace is on the loose in the quiet
Pittsburgh suburb of Mt. Lebanon.

Eighty—one—year—old Harold Greenberger was up to
his old tricks again and the community was worried.
Greenberger targets kids as his main source of income 
and regularly looks for younger and younger patrons to f
whom he might sell his wares. Residents of Mt Lebanon,

' became angry and filed complaints. Finally, the policsf;

had no choice but to take action against the old man. _g
What vile business does Greenberger rim? He sells"
ice cream cones. What heinous crime against humanity
has he committed? Greenberger violates a noise ordi-
nance every time he plays his jingle from the speak- pl
ers on his ice cream truck. ?
Last month, Mt. Lebanon seceded from?
Saneville and became its own country of Crazylandj
Their ﬁrst act: badgering an ice cream truck driver,!
Greenberger has been selling his delicious treats
since 1945 and is the owner of Chuck’s Ice Cream.
In most suburban “Leave It To Beaver’ ’-esque bor-
oughs, Greenberger is a welcomed businessman,
loved by young and old alike. But when Greenberger
drives his big white truck into Mt. Lebanon, they
make it clear that he is unwanted. .
Residents protested having to endure such‘ harsh
conditions as having to listen to the ice cream truck jin-
gles for the hour and a half that Greenberger infects their
community. Some called the police. One person phoned
Greenberger directly to yell at him. :4
According to articles in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,
police issued Greenberger a written warning and told him

 

David J. McCarthy

Colurrmist

that if he insists on doing business in Mt. Lebanon, he
must cruise the streets in complete silence. Failure to do
so would result in a $50 ﬁne every time he broke the law.
As a resident of Baldwin Borough, a neighbor to Mt
Lebanon and the area that Greenberger calls home, I feel
especially strong ties to this particular case. In Baldwin,
we do not boo our ice cream men. But‘ I, know “Mt.
I.ebanon’s reputation. Mount Lebo, as it was called, car-
ried two steady reps back in my high school days. No. 1:
being a real ass-kicker at ice hockey. N o. 2: being a breed-
ing ground for old, rich, cranky, white people. I
Old, rich, cranky, white people do two things really
well: bitch and moan. These two
ideals are exempliﬁed by their super-
hero, Old Man Stick-up-the-ass.

You have met Old Man Stick-
up-the-ass. He’s" the one responsible
for curfews on trick-or-treating times
and the fact that‘ every ﬁrework,
except sparklers, is illegal in

let you cut through his lawn on the

though it took -20 minutes oﬁ your

kickball rolled into his lawn, shot it with his Civil War

musket and stopped to cackle at the crying children. We

all know Old Man Stick—up-the-ass, and Mt. Lebanon
-knows him a little too well.

In most communities, Old Man Stick-up-the-ass is

called things like “a mean 01’ sourpuss” and then gets tor-

Pennsylvania. He’s theone that never .
way home from your bus stop, even‘

walk. He’s the one who, when the ',

mented on Devil’s Night. But in Mt. Lebanon, Old Man «

Stick-up-the-ass is gloriﬁed. He’s even gotten others to
join his cause of ridding the earth of fun. "

Harold Greenberger is a danger to no one. He isn’t
selling crack to children; he’s selling ice cream cones.
While ice cream may be crack to the dentists/vegans of
America, for the rest of us, it’s good old-fashioned yum-
miness. The residents of Mt. Lebanon ought to be
ashamed. ‘ ‘ « L

Greenberger does not drive a ‘90 Honda Accord with
a trunk full of subwoofers. He does not blast profanity
from his truck; in fact, his music _does not even "contain
words. He is an ice cream-truck driver, doing what every
ice cream-truck driver has done‘ for decades. No one, not
even the most cold—hearted, should have a problem with
him

‘Besides, unless you are Satan, the jingling sounds of .

an ice cream truck should be pleasant  nostalgic.
Greenberger cannot sell his ice cream if nobody
knows his truck is around. That is why he fears that, in the
waning days of suitable icecream-selling weather, he will
have to take Mt. Lebanon to court. If that happens, -the
human race should collectively bow its heads in shame.
In the mean time, Old Man Stick-up—the-as‘s, stop

throwing rocks at puppies and have aeheart. Or at least

have some ice cream. ‘

If David J. worked for Chucks Ice Cream, he would
replace the trucks jingle with N.WA.3‘ “F *** Tha

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since .1906

PAGE 9

Just peacy nversai

Ben Finkelstein is a quirky Pitt stu-

dent who runs the literary and political

, journal The Peachy Compass. Copies

of the most recent issue can be found at

Various local businesses, including

Kiva Han, which is where we sat down

to talk about.his journal, Voting and the
California recall election. . i

«P.

‘ On The Peachy Compass:

Why The Peachy Compass? What is
the origin of that name?

Well, it’s a silly name. I guess we are
rich with juicy fruit and we try and
show people the way. But, um, don’t
take it too seriously.

Why do you have creative‘ writing in
your magazine as well. as political‘
essays? Because it seems like politics
is your main focus..

The’ whole publication is about bring-
ing people together and bringing
together ideas, and it’s not supposed to
just be political, it’s supposed to b
cultural, social. ‘ .

Do you feel, that certain kinds of
writing don’t get published in the
other literary magazines on campus?
Is that one of the reasons you wanted
creative writing V in The Peachy
Compass? ‘ -
Yeah, I think that there’s a real dearth
of really creative writing in the main-
stream at Pitt. And there are a lot of
ideas that don’t get presented; they’re
not read and they’re not understood,
and that’s what this is about, trying to
further understanding. '

On voting: »

You wrote, in the last essay you pub-
lished about student apathy, that
people our age are not voting and not
registering to vote, so could you talk
a little about that?
How do you call it "a democracy when
hardly half of the people who are eligi-
ble to vote, vote? These are supposed
to _be decisions that affect our lives
directly and, what, people just don’t
care about their lives? So I’m asking
why, because people do care about
their lives. And, you know, [only] 3 ’
percent of all» eligible students vote
because politicians don’t talk to them,
politicians don’t say ‘We’re going to
do things to make education in
America better, we’re going to do
-things to create jobs for young people,
’ we’re going to do things to help further

peop1e’s creative interests’ —— the gov-

ernment does_n’t say things like that.

_So, students don’t care because they

feel disenfranchised by the political
system. v

So you think it’s up to us?

I think it’s up to us to sort of realize our
power and say, ‘This is about our lives,
it’s going to make a" difference in our
lives and future lives.’ We need to har-
ness our power and get out and vote
out these crap-shitters that are current-
ly in office. . -'

On the California recall election:

‘Maria Shriver scares me, that’s all I

have to say.

KATIE MAVRICH/A & E EDITOR

You know, Larry Flynt, he’s going to
win it.

This whole thing is just so ridiculous ’

It is; it’s so off—the-wall. And it’s such
a ﬂip-ﬂop of what democracy is sup‘-
posed to be.

I used to live in California, actually.
Really? Who would you be voting for?
Would you vote no on the recall?

  Yeah, I wound. I think it’s totally fab-

ricated; it’s not what the people real-
ly wanted.
The whole thing was just put together
by rich people to further their political
ambitions.

Eighth grade, for many people,
was the year of first dates and first
kisses. It was in eighth grade that
girls may have learned the “rule” for
when to accept a “date” and when not
to. If a guy asked a girl out for the
weekend on or before Wednesday,
then it was OK to accept. But if he
procrastinated until Thursday or
Friday, then a girl should decline -—
she doesn’t want to look like a loser
with no plans for the weekend. » ,

It’s Wednesday, so that means
you have ample time to find someone
to go back to those glorious middle
school days with. On Friday, WPTS
92.1 FM, Pitt’s radio station, is host-
ing ‘90s Dance Party: Dance Like
You’re In Eighth Grade.

And dance like you’re in eighth
grade you shall. Some of the pres-
sures of those horrible Friday night
dances will probably be gone — like
convincing the ‘rents that you are old
enough to wear lipstick without look-

ing like a tramp or that the brown ‘

stuff on your chin is stubble, not dirt,
so you simply must shave.

Throw on your ﬂannel shirts, peg
your jeans and get ready to feel the
angst as you rock out to Nirvana,
steal kisses to slow, annoying Mariah
Carey songs and drink un—spiked —

or not —-— punch as Ini Kamoze gets A

you all revved up with “Hot Stepper.”

Since we’re older and, hopefully,
more mature, after you gather the
courage to ask that special someone
to slow dance, chances are you won’t
be‘ doing so arm’s length apart. Try
not to imitate “Dirty Dancing,”
though, this is a ‘90s dance party, not
an ‘80s one.

And finally, the pure beauty of
this dance party is that, unlike those
middle school soirees, people from
other schools can attend —— as long as
they are from schools of higher edu-
cation, since anyone younger won’t
be able to truly appreciate the music
of the ‘90s — and you ‘no longer have
a curfew.

The ‘90s Dance Party: iDance Like
You’re In 8th Grade takes place Fri.,
Oct. 10, from 10:30 p.m. until 2 a.m.,
in the William Pitt Union Assembly
Room. A college ID is required and
admission is $4.

writer, Linford Detweiler, along
with a handpicked five—piece band,
carries her vocals.

The band’s 10th release, Ohio,
is‘a contemporary album that covers
many genres. The double-disk
album contains 21 songs that are-
stripped down and raw; all recorded
on a 16—track analog tape machine.
They wanted to produce the most

natural, unrefined sound that they _

could get. The,latest technology and
loops just wouldn’t
work. They wanted,
to sound the way

their idols, Willie
Nelson and Janis
Joplin, did.
9 Over the Rhine’s

members are mostly
out to please them-
selves. They make
the music that makes
them happy and just
hope that there are
people out there who
enjoy it as much as
they do.

Their record label,
Back Porch Records,
let them record the
whole album without
listening to any sam-.
ples of it until it was
almost finished. At
that point, Over the
Rhine realized, that

%

they were making a double album
and were pleasantly surprised that
Back Porch stepped back and let
them do everything their way.

Although they haven’t received
a huge reception in the United
States, Over the Rhine’s past tours
through Europe have always been
successful. The fan base they do
have in the United States is very
dedicated and has stuck by them
throughout the past decade. Many
critics would agree that they are one
of" the most overlooked talents in
America. '

Bergquist-and Detweiler both‘

were raised in small coal towns in
Ohio and bringa little piece of that
with them through their simple and
straightforward performances.
Along with their stop in Pittsburgh,
they are touring throughout the
United States until December, and
are in the midst of planning a
United Kingdom tour in 2004.

Over the Rhine will play at
Moondog’s in Blawnox tomoritow
night at 7:30 p.m. Tickets for the
21-and-over show are $13. For
more information, call (412) 828-

COURTESY MIRAMAX PICTURES

First half of Tarantino’s epic ﬁlm is a complete hit
gtigrrgilgytl/n?;u$t?rr11an, Vivica A. Fox, Lucy
Liu, David Carradine

Directed by Quentin Tarantino
s2ni‘ni‘r 1'/2

At the halfway point, my mind is blown.

Rather than gutting his massive director’s cut of
“Kill Bill” —— reportedly around four hours —
writer-director Quentin Tarantino, opted to release it
in two parts. “Volume l” is literally half a ﬁlm.

The rest doesn’t arrive until February, but I’m
already comfortable saying the words “living,
breathing masterpiece.” “Volume 2” can’t come fast

only dive three or four tracks deep before realizing
that every song blends into the next, with the same
three or four chords and similarly paced vocals.

enough. .

If /you spent years feeding a computer the choic-
est trash cinema —— blaxploitation, kung fu blood-
baths, bad-girl ﬂicks, nasty revenge pics, etc. —— it

might, upon overload, spit back something close to‘

“Kill Bill.” But you’d still need the deep, resonant
sadness that’s at the heart of Tarantino’s ﬁlm. _
“Bill” is every bit the homage to the ﬁlms that

"made Tarantino the particular monster he is that fans

are expecting. It’s primarily a euphoric celebration of
the depravity of the ‘70s B-film world. One sequence
goes black—and—white — the Motion Picture
Association of America is more accepting of blood if
it’s not red ——.— for an extended, eye—popping, samu-
rai—sword massacre’. There’s also a spectacular anime
sequence that culminates in a veritable blood storm.

With Tammy Ealom, John Hill and Darren

I have some male friends who look at female
singers and fema1e—fronted bands with such dis-
dain that it’s sad. They’re willing to listen to bands

with female guitarists or drummers — just as long a I

as they have male singers. And that’s too bad.
They are missing out on key artists and bands, like
Joan Jett, Hole, Garbage and The Bangles. What
they won’t miss are the Spice Girls, Wilson
Phillips and Dressy Bessy.

Dressy Bessy’s latest release, creatively titled
Dressy Bessy, is mediocre, to say the least. The
music isn’t bad, per se, but it really isn’t good,
either. The opening track, “Just Once More,” is
catchy. Since it’s the first song on the album, it’s
going to get the most ear time from those who lis-
ten to the album. This is because listeners may

Albert all contributing to the percussion beats, one
would think that they would be a bit more compli-
cated. But the drumming is so simple that a sec-
ond-year band student could play it effortlessly.

It’s so hard not to get stereotypical and say
that I can picture girls decked out in Roxy surf
wear rocking out to this CD. Though the band
hails from snowy Denver, their tunes radiate the
feeling of hot sand and crashing waves.

The odd thing about the album, however, is
that despite all of the above pitfalls, no single song
is so bad that you will want to change the radio
station or press the mute button —— it’s just so
mediocre. It doesn’t make you feel one way or
another. It isn’t something to rave about, nor is it
something to rant about. It’s an album that’s sim-
ply there.

—Katie Mavrich, A & E Editor

The unexpected part is the emotion under it all.
The opening, shot alone is devastating —— a single
long take of Uma Thurman as the Bride, bloody and
battered in her wedding dress, with minutes, perhaps
seconds, to live. The voice of Bill comes, then a gun-
shot. As if it was created speciﬁcally for this film,
“Bang Bang,” written by Sonny Bono and sung by
Nancy Sinatra, plays over the opening credits. This
sequence hurts.

When she wakes up in a hospital four years after
that gunshot, revenge is all the Bride has left. She
was once a contract killer. When she quit the Deadly
Viper Assassination Squad,‘ her former colleagues

and boss, the mysterious Bill (David Carradine)",

Once,twice,  timesthe  .

The Artist in the Ambulance
Thrice ’

Island Records

it

t Thrice, a four-man band from sunny
California, formed in 1998, with only the
desire to start making music‘ and see where
it went from there. It’s been a long road to
where they are now, but it was well worth
it for the band; they recently signed with
major label Island Records.

Their new album, The Artist In The
Ambulance, is their third release to date,
their previous two being pushed by
Hopeless/SubCity Records.

The nice thing about Thrice is that
proceeds from their album sales not only
beneﬁt the band but also go to charity orga-
nizations. This concept was formed for
Thrice while starting out with
Hopeless/SubCity who are major support-
ers of charities.

The Artist In the Ambulance beneﬁts
the Syrentha J. Savio Endowment (SSE).
The endowment, based in Washington,
D.C., aims to provide free cancer screen-
ing for individuals who cannot aﬁord the
expense. If someone. is diagnosed, the
endowment will provide ﬁnancial assis-
tance for those who cannot afford treat-

a ment on their own.
It’s a noble thing for a band on a major 

label to continue to do, and shows that
these guys know where they come from

and stick to what they ﬁnd works.

One thing that doesn’t work, however,
is that the album is confusing to the listen-
er. Maybe it’s confusing to the band too,
because it’s hard to tell if Thrice is a heavy
punk band or a soft-core metal band.

They seem to be torn between the two
styles, and it makes the album a jumbled
mess. It’s a very good thing to have diver-
sity in your songs, but when they push and
pull the way they do on Artist, it just leaves
the listener wanting more of one style and
less of the other, and it pulls the whole
album down.

The ﬁrst track, “Cold Cash and Colder
Hearts,” is a good opening track that is a
driving and somewhat heavier punk song,
with subtle screams and raging guitar riffs.

The ﬁrst single to be released, “All
T‘hat’s Left,” follows two heavy tracks on
the album, and it seems awkward and out
of place where it lies on the track listing.
It’s a signiﬁcantly lighter track then “Cold
Cas ” and the second track “Under a
Killing Moon,” which is one of those
heavy metal songs that doesn’t ﬁt right for
Thrice.

If they had simply picked one style
and ran with it, this album would have got-
ten three stars.It would be a solid album
perfect for multiple spins. But the way it is,
it falls short miserably, and is better off
resting on the shelf at the record store,
gathering dust.

Mason Jennings
brings emotion

With an acoustic guitar accompa-
nied by a powerful, soulful voice,

’ Mason Jennings strives to sing the ulti-

mate love song." Every song on his third
album, Century Spring, sticks to the
theme of pain that love brings, and it
comes from the heart.

Born in Honolulu, Hawaii, but
raised here in Pittsburgh, Jennings
works to rid love songs of the cliched
formula that pop culture and pop music
have driven it toward.

Jennings is constantly touring, and
has made his way across the United
States as well as across the world, play-
ing all over Europe and Australia. He
has a knack for singing his songs with
emotion that touches the senses while
soothing the soul. .

“Living in the Moment” is a great
song about living for now with the ones
that you love: ‘‘All our lives will be
recorded and replayed again/One*day it
hit me this ain’t a movie/Now I’m liv-
ing in the moment with the friends I
love.”

“Sorry Signs on Cash Machines” is
a sweet love song. “I know true love
don’t love like anybody else/I know
your heart don’t beat like anybody
else.” “New York City” is a song that
feeds on the life of New York; the city
and its entities fuel the upbeat song.

“Bullet” is a different twist in the
album. It picks up pace a little more
than -the love songs; it’s actually more

of an anti—love song, with lines like

“You’re not Cinderella,so don’t forget

your shoes/I’ve never been as lonely as ~

when I was with you.”
With a fun side as well as a driving
emotional force behind his music,

Mason Jennings takes on the intimate -

setting of Club Cafe tonight for a bit-
tersweet evening of beautiful music.

Mason Jennings and Joey Murphy will
play Club, Cafe in the South Side
tonight at 10:30 pm. Tickets for the 21-
and-over show are $12. For more
information, call (412) 431-4950.

left her with a bullet in the head. But
she’s still alive, and on a mission to get
them all back. Especially Bill.

Two elements of the film are per-
fect above all else. The first is the orig-
inal music by RZA, who must be quite
the connoisseur of the films that
inspired this one; damn, does he get it.
Like Tarantino’s filmmaking style, the
music references other films and adds
its own edge. , '

The second is Thurman, who it’s
all riding on. She’s electric in a way
she isn’t for anyone but Tarantino. We

have to stay with‘ her through her bru-
tal past and future, even as she engages
in some seriously cold—blo.oded behav-
ior. And we’ve got her back the whole
way. _

To those who condemn Tarantino
as a thief: yes, he stole every bit of
“Kill Bill” from other films —— and cre-
ated one of the most original ﬁlms in
recent memory.

“Kill Bill” isn’t perfect. Not yet.
It’s only intermission.

The Pitt volleyball team went

opponents over the weekend to
increase their winning streak to
seven matches.

The Panthers (V13-3 overall, 3-0

Villanova (4-12, 1-3), but gathered A
themselves together to sweep the

next three games. The next day, Pitt
traveled to Georgetown (5-11, 1-3)

“The hard thing is sometimes
you play teams that  are obvious-

When I was 15 years ‘old, I was
taken advantage of by the Penn
State football program in .a scheme

that resulted in emotional scarring

and destroyed all of my previous
admiration for those infamous
Nittany Lions. .

It cost me $400 and some
change to go to Penn.State football
camp for three despondent days

that year. The brochure that sucked 1

me in promised an experience filled
with opportunities to learn hands-
on from Penn State players and

‘coaches, and a meeting with the big

cheese himself, head coach Joe
Paterno.

While, .I’ll admit my expecta-

tions were extremely high and I had
visions of the coaching staff drool-

the camp completely failed to live
up to its words. '

those three abysmal days with sec-

iond-string players and assistant

coaches who I had never heard of.
And, to top it all off, that poor

vco—campers and I were told, “some—

because I didn’t have big enough
shoulders to playfootball. As soon
as I was able to play — I think I
was around eight — I was the cen-
ter and I wanted to play running
back, ‘so I quit. [laughs] When I was
nine years old,—I started playing
again, and I ended up playing line-
man. [laughs]

TPN: When did you decideto stick

I with football?

BM: God put .the passion in me

, from a young age. It’s just some-
thing that I love. Other sports were

more of hobby that I did for fun and
to stay in shape. ’

TPN: What goes through your mind
during the time between leaving the
huddle and the snap?

BM: I’m trying‘ to process the play.
We make adjustments at the line, so
I’ll yell out stuff to [fullback]
Lousaka Polite and I’ll mess up his
groove.

He always likes to tell me after
the game to shut up and stuff.
[laughs] That’s all right. I’m just
trying to think about my reads. ‘

TPN: Is it any different when you
know the ball is coming to you?

BM: I think so. I think it’s a sense
of responsibility; I’ve got to get out
there and do something on the next
play. This is a team sport, and I
know thatwe need all 11 players
doing what they’re supposed to do

‘ for us.to' be successful. Ijust have

to trust in my teammates, and they

= need to trust in me.

TPN: Do you have any pregame rit-
uals you go through? '

BM: [laughs] I try to stay»-away
from certain things. I find myself
trying to eat the same foods or do
the same things. I’m not a big rou-
tine guy. _

No, I’m not a ritualistic guy;
I’m a routine guy. That?s a good
word.

TPN: What’s the most embarrass-
ing thing that has ever happened to
you while on the field?

BM: I remember in high school, we
were playing our rival and we were
down and we got a quick turnover. I
got a pitch and ran the ball in the
end zone and I’m hyped. I keep run-

M

lning, I run through the end zone. I

keep running onto the track with my
cleats on, and it’s slippery. I run out
there, news cameras right on me,
and I slip. I got up so fast, and I
knew they were going to ‘play’ it on
the news later, but they ended up
cutting it out. [laughs]

TPN: What’s your favorite; sport
other than football? '

BM: I like basketball. As far as
watching something, I watch. bas-
ketball during the playoffs, because
during the regular season, they play
no defense. [laughs] It’s no use
watching. I like playing golf. '

TPN: How much different has it

_ been now that you have graduated

and are in grad school?

BM: I’m not‘ around campus _as

‘much. Usually, you see people out-

side the [William Pitt Union]. I’m
not even over. there half the time;
I’m going to school twice a week. I
feel so far away, like.out of touch.-

BM: Let’s see —— I go to church.
You know, Bible study. I watch

love movies. Surf the- Internet, I
guess. [laughs] _ 0'

TPN: If we were to look in you

probably old also —— eggs and some

juice.

TPN: If-you could date any celebri-
ty, who would it be?

BM: I couldn’t say. I have a girl-
friend — she’s my celebrity.

TPN: What’s something that people
would be surprised to know about
you?

BM: I guess, [for] people outside of

efforts of a highly intoxicated stu-
dent, who — wearing a toga in the
freezing rain —- repeatedly dove
through the mud and proceeded_to
belly-flop in front of a massive pre-
game tailgating crowd.

The student body was more into
this kid than any part of the game,
and for good reason — their team
stinks. In a 30-23 loss to ‘ the
Badgers, the Nittany Lions’ record
fell to a lousy 2-4 on their home-
coming, in front of a crowd of over
107,000.

I doubt that I could have

watched such pitiful football with-
out the help of a six-pack or two.

Though I find it extremely
humorous to see the enemy plum-
met, there is a more serious issue
that has grabbed my attention.
Paterno is entirely too old to be
coaching at a major university, and
he appears to be completely out of
place. V

He has done wonders for his
football program during his 38-year
tenure at the head coaching posi-
tion, but that’s beside the point. He
has dug himself into a hole with his
decision not to retire, and there’s
not much room to climb out; the

hole keeps getting bigger.

Paterno simply cannot keep up
with the younger coaches across the
nation when it comes to recruiting.
He’s losing potential players to Big
East schools, something that never
used to happen, and there seems to
be a lack of respect from the ones
that are brought in. . _

Regardless of his past, with 338
wins and two national champi-
onships, his style is outdated and a
bad team looks to be getting worse
right before his eyes. _

The legend of Joe Pa is quickly
fading away, and if he wants people

depart at the end of the season, in
order to maintain a sturdy relation-
ship with his supporters.

Otherwise, the only thing that ‘

Penn State fans will remember
about Joe Pa is this terrible team
that currently stands behind him
and the many more that will come
in years ahead, if he sticks around.

And by the way, this Friday
night, ESPN will be airing a one-

“The Season: Joe Paterno.” I have
high hopes that the season does not

they may want to change the name
