TUESDAY, SEPTEMBER 16, 2003

CHRISTIAN NIEDAN

The era of the greenback is on its way out t_l1e door and
into oblivion.

The U. S. Treasury Department’s Bureau of Engraving
and Printing will release a new, peach-colored $20 bill into
circulation across the United States on Oct 9. The new bill
will mark the ﬁrst of a series of color changes planned for
U.S. paper currency over the next few years.

VV1th a background of subtly’ differing peach, blue and
green hues, the new bill will be, ‘aside from one abortive
attempt in the early 20th century, the first new US. paper cur-
rency since the Civil War not to feature green as its 
color. Other new features include the absence of a circle
around J ackson’s portrait and small, yellow 20s in the back- _
ground of one side. 4 l _ »

Money enthusiasts can expect new $50 and $100 bills in
2004 and 2005, respectively, and each will have its own color
scheme. Representatives at __ the Federal Reserve — the
nation’s central bank —— said the bank will try to introduce
new currency designs every 7 to 10 years.

The Federal Reserve is considering including $5 and
$10 bills in the color changes, as well; -

Some changes to Americancurrency haven’t turned out

-well. In the late 1970s, the Treasury Department promoted

the Susan B. Anthony silver dollar as the fut11re of U.S..
money, touting its “cost saving eﬂiciency” with a massive
Publicity campaign .

I The U.S. Mint rolled out approximately
one billion of the silver dollars between 1979 .
and 1981, but they failed to catch on.
Americans tended to ignore the coins and
continued doing transactions in cash and,
with increasing frequency, electronically.

The most recent series of American
paper currency redesigns began in 1996,
when a new $100 bill was introduced and
followed by new $50, $20, $5 and $10 bills
in the following years. In addition to new
portraits, those bills featured such innova-
tions as light-sensitive “watennark” images

others ingrained into the paper itself, vertical
security strips, and ink that appears either
copper or green, depending the angle of light
from which it is viewed .» r —

The new bills willoontinue to use all
these features, as well. ' '

Though many Americans might react
strongly to the new look of currency, the‘
owners of machines dealing in paper money‘
will feel the change most directly. The
Treasury Department has been working with -

the vending, garn-
ing and public trans-
portation industries
for more than a year,
mailing out more than
7,500 requested
changeover informa-
tion packets to help
them adjust machines to
accept the new bills.

, Since all the plarmed
current changes are for
denominations of $20 or
higher, it isn’t expected to
be as diﬁicult a problem as
might arise if the $1 bill — by far the most commonly used
denomination in money machine industries — were altered.

Constant combat with counterfeiters motivated the
Federal Reserve to ‘make the changes to American bills, both

in 1996 and this year. Those trying to pass oﬁ false U.S. cur— -

rency prefer large denomination bills, worth $20 or more.

During the Revolutionary War, one colonial
Pennsylvania note explicitly ; stated on its front, “To
Counterfeit is Death,” attesting to the widespread problem of
false currency, even several hundred years ago.

By the Civil War years, when an estimated one-third of
paper money was counterfeit, the rapidly advancing -science
of photography created rampant counterfeiting with the use
of cameras. Green currency emerged as a result, since no

photographic

The Secret Service, createdby the U. S. treasury in 1865
to corrﬂoat counterfeiters, also arose during the Civil War era.
Their elforts against counterfeiting were so elfective that
their agency was chosen for the job of guarding leading U.S.
government oﬁicials. Today, the Secret Service seizes 190
percent of all counterfeit U.S. currency before it enters circu-
lation, according to the agency.

Early in the 20th century, another redesign of the $20 bill
emerged brieﬂy. This one featured George Washington and
contained yellow, red, green" and black ink, with a golden
design on the back ,

But this bill proved too costly, and green soon returned.

During the 20th century,.foreign countries began trading

, Counterfeiters have ' rapidly ' taken
advantage of new technologies by turning to

digital counterfeiting of currency, which is .
easier and cheaper than old measures.

According to the U.S. Secret Service, less
than 1. percent of counterfeit notes in the U.S.
in 1995 were digitally made. By 2002, that
number had swelled to around 40 percent.
Banks and other government institu-
tions will still accept green currency for the
time being, but large-denominated green
bills will eventually be phased out of circu-
lation entirely. ‘

EDITORIAL

Safety should be last to go in tight times

Violent crime in Pittsburgh is on
the rise, with 21 people dead from
homicide since August and armed
home invasions and shootings
becoming increasingly common in
Oakland, not to mention Sunday
night’s melee at the Original Hot
Dog Shop —— a fistfight in the street
involving nearly fifty people.

With safety clearly at a premium,
the city and the University should be
doing everything possible —- despite
budget shortfalls —— to make the city
safe for residents and students alike.

It would seem that the Murphy
administration is bent on doing just
the opposite. As part of recent bud-
get cuts, 88 police officers were laid
off. ’

The Fraternal Order of Police
offered to forego a 4 percent raise so
that city police who’d been laid off
could get rehired. Such generosity
and clearheaded thinking in the face
of the city’s financial crisis is
remarkable — regardless of the
FOP’s motives, be they self-preser-
vation, safety concerns or, most like-
ly, a combination of the two.

The city’s reaction was also
remarkable -— remarkably foolish.
Along with the offer to forego the
raise, the FOP demanded — reason-
ably enough — that the city set min-
imal staffing levels for police. The
city refused, effectively killing a

measure that could help prevent
sparse ‘police coverage i_n the city.
If the city drops the ball, as it

clearly has in this instance, Oakland.
at least should be some sort of haven‘

— the University is a behemoth-like
presence and maintains a police
force of its own. However, Pitt’s
officers are poorly paid and their
jurisdiction is not clearly defined,
making it very difficult for them to
have an effective presence.

Even in the face of rising tuition
costs, an extra fee tacked onto
tuition to subsidize and help expand
the Pitt police force would be an
investment most students would
likely be willing to make, and if not
the students themselves, then their
parents or tuition-paying guardians.

Though no arrests were made
and no one was seriously hurt, the
fact that it took officers from all four
city zones as well as from the sher-
iff’s department and the Port
Authority half an hour,,according to
an O manager, to quell the violence,
is a disgrace, and indicates things
aren’t working as they should.

The city is in a budget crisis.
Everyone understands that that’s the
reason for pool closings and the
threat to public transportation. Belt-
tightening measures are never com-
fortable, but public safety must
always be the highest priority.

Looking to the north for same-sex, Sanity

Despite the chance (of burning in Hell,
some folks are crossing ‘the world’s longest
unprotected border in search of a right all
straight Americans are allowed to enjoy.
Although this window may only be open
brieﬂy, the queemess of the situation has
many Americans concerned.

If Canadians are already allowing gay
marriages, it may only be a matter of time

before the concept of being allowed to marry -
. the person you love, even if they have the

same genitals as you, might
catch on here. Strong oppo-
sition resounds from all lev-
els of the U.S. govemment
and religious groups. Many
fear a domino effect much
like with Communism,
pointing out that Canada is a
larger country than we are
— if she were to stand up
and then quickly fall over
on top of us, we would all
be smothered in gay.

for taking a great big step
into reality. I mean, really, despite what you

Inexplicably, straight people will no longer
fall in love and want to get married anymore.
On the other hand, there is the possibility
that, even if people were allowed to many
anything they wanted, many would still pre-
fer a human partner of the opposite sex.
Below the skin, some of us are made
uncomfortable or even disgusted by homo-
sexuality. If same-sex unions were accepted,
we’d have to see young men holding hands

they are afraid of is debat-

able. Maybe some people just can’t stand ,

anything outside the norm. Perhaps the pos-
sibility that something that has been popu-
larly considered evil for centuries is, in fact,
all right is too Earth—shattering for certain
people. Or maybe some people are afraid of
what they may learn about themselves if
they take a good hard lookat a glossy picture
of a person of the same sex.

Unlike with pot, there is no legitimate
controversy over the positive and negative
health effects of ‘homosexual relationships.
That’s because being gay isn’t dangerous to‘
oneself or other people. And certainly, any
marriage that’s done for the right reasons is a
good one. No moral argument holds water.

DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA
Assistant A & Editor

The sounds of a ‘50s or ‘60s biker movie
and of ‘80s English New -Wave will be
pounding out of Rosebud tonight.

The Raveonettes are Denmark’s
answer to the White Stripes. Comprised of
guitarist and vocalist Sune Rose Wagner
and bassist/vocalist Sharin F00, The
Raveonettes play music that’s quick, ener-
getic and simple. They broke onto the
music scene with their debut EP, Whip It
On, and have recently released their latest
effort, Chain Gang of love. _

The new material from The
Raveonettes keeps to the tradition of Whip
It On, with quick songs that are catchy
without being hollow. But Chain Gang of
love seerns,-at times, like a lost recording
from an experimental band from the late
‘50s. Songs like “Remember,” “Noisy
Summer,” “Let’s Rave On” and the title
track sound like songs that could have been
found in a biker movie or pieces of music
that could ﬁnd their way onto the sound-

track of Kenneth Anger’s “Scorpio
Rising.”

But don’t pass off the band as some
strange, nostalgic White Stripes knockoff
-— they employ a full band in their live
shows and their music is much less heavy,
both in terms of the sound and the lyrics,
than that of Jack and Meg White.

The other band, stellastarr*, also has a
sound from a bygone era, though one clos-
er to the present Comprised of singer/gui-
tarist Shawn Christensen, bassist Amanda
Tarmen, guitarist Michael Jurin and drum-
mer Arthur Kremer, stellastarr* has a sound
that conjures memories of Joy Division,
The Talking Heads and The Cure, among
other New Wave bands from the ‘80s.

The band started in the late ‘90s when
Christensen, Tannen and Krerner started
the band Ghistor, a short-lived musical
experiment that was more notable in giving
the group, who had relatively little musical
experience, a chance to get their feet wet.
Once Jurin was brought into the fold,
Ghistor gave way to stellastarr*.

The group’s debut album, Advance

Music, hits
stores on Sept.
23. It’s an
impressive
debut that cap-
tures the spirit
of the ‘80s
New Wave
movement —-
the songs are
musically rich
with playful
and fun lyrics
— and is an
impressive
start from the
young band.

Come on and ride the train —-— the metro train

Heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, metrosexual.
Metrosexual?

Metrosexuality is the latest addition to the
“sexuals.” While the origin of the term dates
back to 1994, it hasn’t come into frequent
use until recently. It» made its way into the
2003 edition of Webster’s Millennium
Dictionary of English, which I can’t seem to
ﬁnd anywhere in the area and is only available
online to paying customers.

However, oodles of diiferent deﬁnitions for
the term can be found on the Internet

According to www.wordspy.con1, a metro-
sexual is “A dandyish narcissist in love with not only
himself, but also his urban lifestyle; a straight man
who is in touch with his feminine side.”

VH1 ’s new show, “Totally Gay,” has deﬁnitions
online to help those who aren’t quite up to speed with
the lingo. According to the lexicon, a metrosexual is “A
highly style-conscious urban male with an expanded sense
of masculinity.”

In a July 9 column in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,
columnist Samantha Bennett says of a stereotypical metro-
sexual: “He is young, urban, desperately hip and has lots of
money to spend on himself. He uses expensive moisturiz-
ers on his skin, takes his hair to a salon, not a barber shop,
and likely has it colored, and he passionately follows fash-
1on.” ‘

Basically, to be a metrosexual, you must be a straight
male livingin an urban setting and do things to alter or
improve your appearance that have been deemed “femi-
nine,” without thinking about the monetary consequences.

Katie Mavrich
A & E Editor

No longer can you assume a man is
gay because he’s at the table next to
-you in a nail salon, getting a,mani—
cure. The term “pretty boy” now
applies to gay . and straight people
alike.

      
 

Brad Pitt is a metro. Hell, Tobey
Maguire’s Spiderrnan . was a very
metrosexual being, according to an
article on Salon.com.

Recently, one of the guys I used
to date buﬁ‘e_d up and shaved his chest
hair. As hot as he was before, he’s damn
smoking now. If only my boyfriend
would travel that road.

I’m not saying Buff Boy is a
true metrosexual, although he is comfort-

_ able admitting that he would have sex with a certain male

rock god if the opportunity presented itself. He’s merely
displaying a few qualities possessed by metrosexuals.

Now, before I begin raving about how cool the metro-
sexual is and why, let me say this: Ladies, I know not all of
you put painstaking time and money into your appearance.
Some of you may not need to in order to be the beautiful
creatures that you are. Others just: don’t feel the need to suc-
cumb to the pressures of vanity and prefer the au naturel
look

I fall somewhere in the middle. I am quick to put
myself together, but, as Amy Smart’s character in “Varsity
Blues” says, “It costs a lot of money to look cheap.”

My hair is highlighted, my nails are fake, I’ve had

David Beckhafrn is a metro. »

braces, work out daily and I go tanning. All of these things
have vastly improved my appearance, and if you don’t
believe me, I’ll gladly show you a picture of myself before
any of these things occurred. i
There is a reason that gayguys are some of the hottest
guys out there. On “Totally Gay,” someone stated that met-,
ros are straight guys doing things that A were. previously
viewed as activities done by gay men. ,
Imagine, then, how much hotter some guys could be if

' they followed in the paths of the metrosexual. I see nothing

wrong with a boy with highlights. Nor do I see any prob-
lems with a sun-kissed godin the middle of winter. A six-
pack is way sexier than a beer gut, let me tell you. Who
wants to be caressed by rough hands full of hangnails and
dirt under their nails? ‘ . g -

How nice would it be if you didn’t have to drag your
boyfriend to the mall with you, only to have him moan and
complain the whole time? The ‘pleasure would grow expo-
nentially if he had some fashion sense; if he could tell you
that those pants are so yesterday, or if you look like a mode
in that dress, while he, too, is dressed to kill. . ' -

It would be so great to bond with my boyfriend over ice
cream and pedicures, much like girls do with each other.

_ There’s nothing at all wrong with a man displaying
feminine behavior. Girls slug down beers, ﬁx ﬂat tires and
watch full—contact sports —— it’s their own form of reversed
metrosexuality, if you will. , A

Perhaps the various [insert preﬁx here]-sexuals are on
their way to meshing together as one. Until then, guys
shouldn’t hesitate to travel the metrosexual road and pretty
themselves up — just make sure you return my nail polish,
please.

THE PITT NEWS

Go vertical -—- or horizontal

Go .
Vertical Horizon

RCA Records
ﬁt‘:

It has been slightly more than
three years;s,inc.e the debut album
from Vertical Horizon. They struck
a nerve-— when they released
Everything You Want, which fea-
tured four singles, including the
title track and “You’re a God,” all of
which were huge hits.

Now, three years later, the band

has taken a more mature look at
writing and making music", and have
produced‘ an album that is a testa-
ment to the things in life that you
want to do and the things that need
to be done.

The first single from Go, titled,
“I’m Still Here,” is a poppy song
with catchy guitar riffs, as well as
solid hooks and lyrics. The chorus
asks why things are the way they are
in a messed—up relationship. “The
cities grow the rivers ﬂowl where
you are I’ll never know/ but I’m still
here. / If you were right and I was
wrong/‘why are you the one who’s
gone/ and I’m still here? / I’m still
here.”

Lead singer and. guitarist Matt
Scannell, who sings with passion in
every song, pens emotional songs
about things happening in his every-
day_ life. Along with Scannell is
Keith Kane on guitar, Ed Toth on
drums and Sean Hurley on bass.

Vertical Horizon keeps with the
formula of music made their debut a
success; the music isn’t heavy but

has meaning and depth. The guitar-

riffs are heavier at times, but it’s a
far cry from anything you would
bang your head to. The songs on G0
are a reflection of life, they have
meaning and they are best enjoyed
when listened to, not moshed to.

  places?

So are we.

“Sunshine” is a slightly heavier
song, with a screaming guitar solo
and heavier riffs then the rest of the
songs on the album. The chorus
takes off with, “I see you/ do you
see me too/ close your eyes/ and
leave me in the sunshine/ Come on
through/ I will find you/ Close your
eyes/ and leave me in the sunshine.”

Overall, the album is a good fol-
low up to Everything You Want — a
nice mix of light, emotional tracks
and catchy, poppy tracks that will
no doubt find their way onto radio
with ease.

More than just a movement

lntroducing...Notes from the
Underground

Various Artists

DHP Records

A new/2

As far as hip-hop is concerned, the last

decade has been disappointing-. While many '

individuals ﬁnd comfort in artists such as
Puif Daddy — P. Daddy? P. Diddy? What’s
his moniker nowadays? —— it’s much more_

difficult to ﬁnd the artists‘ who will make you .

sit back and realize that they are doing it for
the pure love of the music, t:h_e scene and the
C11ll1_1I'e. . ‘

' ‘For those of you confused by this point,
hip-hop is not just a musical movement. It is,

indeed, its own culture with its own fashions,

much like those of yuppies, preps, or punks,
with its own discerning musical tastes. The
diiference between hip-hop and rap is much
like that between punk and pop-punk. This
compilation is a ﬁne example of what hip-
hop truly is: the underground love of
rhyming Words. However, it is missing some
essentials that could have made this good
record a great one.

The samples are tight, and the acts are
smooth, but the production is not so silky.
The compilation features ‘artists whose
music is very bass—heavy, which, in itself, is

very acceptable. But when it drowns out
some of the rhymes, which are what hip-hop
thrives on, it gets to be problematic. For
example, on “World Cup,” by Oz, the sam-
ple distorts on the chorus where it should
merely accentuate his already wel1—de1ivered
skill, rather than break any sort of rhythm
and head bob that may be occurring.

For a local eifort, this is still’ surprising-

ly good, asthe  are very intelligent, I

without the usual mindless content that
you’ll ﬁnd in most mainstream rap today. It’s
a refreshing look into some artists that may

, not be getting deserved credit, much like the

aforementioned Oz. The only other‘ nitpick

‘tomakeisthatthisrecordclocksinjust

around the 30-minute mark’. It’s disappoints
ing that there’s only a half hour of music
available on a compilation, seeing how these
artists do have plenty of skill.

A recommendation to future compilers
of music: people like to buy comps’ because
they want to hear a lot of music, not just a
few songs. They could have allowed these
artists to have two cuts, Whichwould give a
much better sampling of their ﬂow and feel.
But on the upside, this compilation does
showcase some ﬁne, local talent from
Pittsburgh and the  Coast, and is worth a
listen if you have a half hour to spare in your
day.

olleyball places second in tournament

JACKIE H_oTEcK
For The Pitt News

‘ The Pitt volleyball team ﬁnished

the Pittsburgh Invitational with a 2-1’.

record over the weekend, giving it ,a
second-place finish behind the Dayton
Flyers. _ 4 

Pitt entered the tournament with an
overall record of 4-2 and with high
expectations. What it hadn’t counted on
was a season-ending injury to one of its
star players, Gini Ullery, in the first
match. ‘

Pitt 3, Ball State 0

‘T he Panthers’ first game against
the Ball State Cardinals (3-7) was
close, with Pitt winning by a score of
30-28. Pitt (6-3) dominated after the
first game, winning the next two games
30-21 and 30-22.

Senior Wendy Hatlestad had 15
kills, leading a group of three Panthers’
players who scored double digits in
kills. Megan Miller contributed 14 kills

and a .379 hitting percentage.

Sarah Rollman registered 11 kills
and had only two errors in her 30

attempts. Megan McGrane turned in a ,

school-record-breaking number ‘of 27
digs in Friday’s match, aiding in the
shutout of Ball State.

During the third game of the

match, Ullery had to be-carried off the

_ court, but was a major contributor in

the Pitt victory, producing -six kills and
11 digs. ‘

Head Coach Chris Beerrnan later ‘

said that Ullery is out for the rest of the
season with a damaged anterior cruci-
ate ligament. A - ‘

Pitt 3, Robert Morris 0

After a rocky start in the first game I

of Saturday’s match, Pitt went on to
win all three games against the Robert
Morris Colonials (7-4). The Panthers
defeated the Colonials 30-22, 30-18
and 30-15.

This match was similar, statistical-
ly, to Friday’s against Ball State, with
four players recording double digits in

/ kills, and Pitt received another strong

performance from McGrane.‘ .
Madelyn Egan joined Hatlestad,
Rollman and .Miller in having 10 or
more kills in the match. Setter Lindsey
Macke had 52 assists; thisematch marks
the ﬁfth time in eight games that she
has had 50 or more assists.
Defensively, the Panthers had a total of
56 digs and came up big in blocking.

Dayton 3, Pitt 0

The Panthers weren’t able to con-
tinue their winning streak on Sunday
when they entered competition against

the Dayton Flyers. The Flyers (7-3)
swept the match, defeating Pitt 30-26,

30-23 and 31-29. The win secured

Dayton’s victory in the tournament, .
Hatlestad and Rollman each had 16
kills in the game, as both players

As Walt Harris prepares his team to play at Toledo
this weekend, he is looking at what has gone on in col-
lege football and is counting his blessings,

A “We’re excited about being 2-0,” Harris said at his
weekly_ press conference. “And after watching some
other football games on Saturday night, we’re even
more excited about being 2-0.”  _. ‘ _

This week, Pitt will travel to Toledo to take ‘on the
Rockets. The Rockets are coming off a huge win over
Marshall on the road last Friday night. . ’

“It’s going to be a tremendous challenge for our

football team,” Harris continued. “We need to contin-
ue to do things correctly in every situation.”
Toledo has an offensive threat in sophomore quarter-
back Bruce Gradkowski. Gradkowski, a Pittsburgh
area native, has averaged 230 yardsper game passing
and has led the Rockets to a record of 2-1.

“He’s a good football player and athlete,” Hanis
said. “He’s like a lot of guys — when they commit
themselves, they work hard, they’ve got talent, and
[as] athletic as he is, you get better. That’s what hap-

pened to him [and] that’s what happened to [Pitt quar-
terback] Rod [Rutherford] and that’s what happens to
a lot of guys who hang in there at that position.”

' Rutherford has been the nation’s most efficient
passer so far this season. His strong play earned him
recognition as the Big East Conference’s Offensive
Player of the Week.

“I think he ‘delivered the ball very well,” Harris
said.- “We’ve just got to get him some time to func-
tion,” Harris continued. “We’ve got to protect the
passer better, we’ve got to pick up blitzes better,
we’ve got to execute against the blitz a little bit better,
we’ve got‘ to block it better.” ’ .

Although Harris sees room for improvement, he
felt that the team had addressed some of his concerns
from a week ago. ‘ *

“I thought our kickoff coverage got better. I
thought Adam Graessle was outstanding. That is a
weapon. He’s a factor,” Harris said. “When our
defense has to defend-80 yards or 81 yards, they are
tough.” ’ ' ’

per player, 'I‘oledo’s offensive line is one of its biggest
strengths, and Harris acknowledges this. 4

Harris prepares Panthers for first road game

“They’ve got some power,” Harris said. “That’s
why they beat Marshall. Marshall is an outstanding
football program. They brought it right at them in the
fourth quarter, on the road, and got it done. It was a
great victory for them and their program.” .

Although road games are always difficult, coach
Harris said that he is eager for the team to experience
its first road trip. ' 8

“Our guys like to play. Our guys like challenges”
Harris said. ‘The way we do a road trip affords our
guys to be together and be tight.”

Comerback Shawntae Spencer shares Harris’ feel-
ings about road games.

. “Personally, I love hostile environments. It ener-
gizes you. You want to quiet the crowd and make big
plays,” Spencer said. , 1

Spencer also-took notice of the improved atten-
dance Pitt has seen at its home games.

“I’ll tell you something, it’s beautiful. When I first
got here, it was really tough. But now, students, the
city and our fans are gathering, and it means a lot. It
helps us out a lot,” Spencer said. “It really means a lot
for us to see our fans there, and hopefully, they will
travel up to Toledo.”

Donovan McNabb is another version of Kordell Stewart

Hey Philly fans, what is 41.4? No,
sony, you wish it was Allen Iverson’s shoot-
ing percentage, but we all know that’s way
too high for him. Actually, 41.4 is Donovan
McNabb’s quarterback rating. »

For the past three years, I have
been saying McNabb was nothing more
than another Kordell Stewart, and
McNabb’s terrible start has given me anoth-
er opportunity to make the comparison.
Let’s take a look, shall we?

I will skip the obvious similarities that
both are mobile quarterbacks that can make
plays with botl1 their legs and their arm, and
I will also ignore the fact that both made
their mark on the National Football League

 

in Pennsylvania

Anyway, both quarterbacks have led
their team to two conference championship
games, and both teams lost those respective
games. Stewart, however, has been to a third

conference championship game and won it,
earning a chance to play in the Super‘Bowl;
it does not matter that Stewart was a wide
receiver at the time.

OK, so both of them have a tendency to

“choke in big games, but how are they doing

this season? Well, both teams, the Chicago
Bears and Philadelphia Eagles,‘ are 0-2 and
have struggled on offense. The Bears have
scored 20 points this season, while the
Eagles scored only 10.

However, the Bears and Stewart did not
have the expectations of the Eagles and
McNabb. Many experts predicted the
Eagles would be Super Bowl winners, or at
least conference champions. The Bears were

predicted to ﬁnish third or fourth in their
division, sometimes predicted to ﬁnish
ahead of the Detroit Lions.

How bad are McNabb’s numbers? In
two games, McNabb is 31 for 82 for 334
yards passing with zero touchdowns and
three interceptions. Steelers starting quarter-
back Tommy Maddox compiled more nurn—
bers on Sunday than McNabb had all year.
Maddox went 28 for 47 for 336 passing
yards, with one touchdown and three inter-
ceptions in ﬂre Steelers’ 41-20 loss to the
Kansas City Chiefs. ,

Stewart has even put up comparable’
numbers to McNabb’s, this season, going 27
for 55 for 232 passing yards, with_ two
touchdowns and three interceptions, giving
Stewart a quarterback rating of 50.0.

I realize it has only been two games,
and it is a long season, but right now, who is
playing better on a worse team? Anyone
who watched the games the past two weeks
knows that the answer is Kordell Stewart.

Elsewhere in the NFL, Ravens’ running
back Jamal Lewis broke Corey Dillon’s sin-
gle game rushing record of 278 yards, by
running for 295 yards in the Raven’s 33-13
victory over the Cleveland Browns. —

Good for him. I am a Steelers’ fan and
basically couldn’t careless about this event,
except for one detail that made me respect
thevfeat more than anything. Lewis said he
was going to do it earlier this week

During arphone call with Cleveland_

Browns’ linebacker Andra Davis earlier in
the week, Lewis said he would break the
record if given 30 carries, which was twice
as many as he had against the Steelers in
week one. Lewis’ ﬁnal statistics: 30 carries
for 295 yards and two touchdowns.

Does anybody, at this point, care about
Maurice Clarett?’ The former/current Ohio
State rtmning back has made more news off
the ﬁeld then any player’ has this season on
the ﬁe1d.If I can make a plea to ESPN, it
would be ﬂuis: only cover people who actu-
ally play. No one cares about Clarett at this
point I would not even mind if they showed
the two billionth promo for “Playmakers”'
instead. I am sure even people in Columbus,
Ohio are tired ‘of this; keep Clarett off my

' screen.

However, I have an idea for ESPN, if
they insist on shoving Clarett" and
“Playmakers” down viewers throats: wait
until Clarett is ofﬁcially done with college
football and cannot enter the NFL, and do
the next best thing —— cast him in
"’P1aymakers.” ‘Bring him in as a late round
pick who can compete against “D.H_.” next
season. I -

Hell, you can use some of his actual sto-
ries in the script, this would give ESPN an
opportunity to combine coverage and pro-
mos of both into one. When will ESPN learn
that too much of a good thing makes it bad?

Matt Miloszewski is a columnistfor The Pitt
News and is sick of “Playmakers, ” Maurice
Clarett and Philly fans talking up an over-
rated Donovan McNabb.
