Some Sutherland ‘residents
woke up a little earlier Saturday
morning, roused by the sounds of

students. taking action to raise.

money for the twin towers relief
fund. A

C-live Pursehouse, Sutherland’s
resident director, and Jessica
Schroth, a Sutherland resident
assistant, organized Saturday’s ben-
efit. Schroth said it was designed
not only to raise money for the
relief effort, but also to “bring stu-
dents together to do something.” A

The benefit, which included
numerous concerts and a raffle,
raised $490, Schroth said.
Pursehouse said they will send the
money, along with messages written
by students, to the relief effort in
New~York. .

the relief provided a “healthy way
for people to deal with feelings
about this.” L

Members of Pitt’s Cornerstone
Christian Fellowship also attended
the benefit. According to member
David Auger, Cornerstone members
came to support Sutherland’s effort
to “spread the gospel” and show
their support by working to raise
money for relief workers in need.

Students in the Hindi Student
Council also came to the benefit.
Ashish Mitra, the group’s president,
said he saw the event as a “benefit
and chance to get together as stu-
dents  to celebrate life and
peace?’

heard guest speakers, marched and had the

Participants chanted slogans ranging‘-.fromi

“Hey, hey mister, get your handsoffmy sis-

we won’t be raped, we won’t be beat.” '

A The students marched approximately 50
people around ' the Cathedral of Learning
before heading into South Oakland. Equipped
with bullhorns, signs and chant sheets, the
march drew _curious studentsto their windows
and porches. .

“I can’t believe how loud they are,” said
Michael Varshine, a senior marketing" major
and South Oakland resident. “They sound like

Hunger forum calls fora livingwage

. KATIE LEONARD
The Pitt News

‘Welfare, terrorism and the living
wage’s relation to hunger were topics
addressed at Just Harvest’s Teach—in
on Hunger, a forum that brought
local college and high school stu-
dents together to learn more about
how the three issues interrelate.

Jonathan Robison, a Just Harvest
representative, said the purpose of
the teach-in was to “share informa-
tion and ideas on three issues that are
important to hunger  and to work
to end conditions that create hunger.”

The forum was divided into three
sections — reforming welfare
reform, hunger and terror, and living
wages and minimum wages, which
were led by Robin Acree, Brit
Holmbreg and Rosemary Trump,
respectively.

Acree, a former welfare recipient
turned advocate, addressed the issue
of welfare’s role in society by com-
paring the old policies to the ones in
place today. ,

Before 1996, Acree said, the gov-
ernment considered welfare an “enti-
tlement,” providing what she called a

legislation focused more on welfare
recipients moving from “welfare to

Acree called the legislation a way
for corporations to get “really cheap
labor.” Businesses
were given subsidies

ernment tolpay part of
the salary of welfare
recipients they hired.

about the “globalization of citizen-
ship.”

Julie Smith, a‘ Pitt sophomore
involved with Bread for the World,
attended the forum to “learn more

about what is really happening in the V

world and Afghanistan.”
Smith said she is concerned

about the plight of Afghanistan.

“Because of our pride, we think we
can just‘ bomb people and that will
solve something,” she said.

Finally, Trump took control of
the discussion to address the living
wage, a hot topic in .a city where

‘numerous city leaders have made_

their backing for such a plan clear.
In Pittsburgh, the living wage —
an amount determined to be enough
to live at a reasonable level of sub-
sistence —— is slightly more than $9‘
with benefits, or about $1 more per
hour if the employee needs to pay for
his or her own insurance. The amount
is far from the federal minimum
wage, now set at $5.15 per hour.
Melissa Clark, president of Pitt’s
Habitat for Humanity, attended the
teach-in because “poverty is an issue
close to my'heart  living wage is an
issue ‘cause people work hard for

Campus religious groups unite
for Ilondenominational prayer

ALLISON BABIN
The Pitt News

While some students noisily
boarded Pitt shuttles in search of col-
legiate merrymaking Saturday night,
Christians converged on the William
Pitt Union lawn for nondenomina-

” tional prayer and songs at the
Christian Meeting in Unity and Love.

At the event, held from 8-10
p.m., volunteers distributed song
lyrics to people wandering onto the
lawn, while others clapped, sang and
danced along with the live music.
Several speakers encouraged having
faith while quoting scripture.

About 100 students attended the
event, representing many groups and
several schools, including
Cornerstone Christian Fellowship,
Inter Varsity Christian Fellowship,
Asian Christian Fellowship, Cross-
Seekers, Chi Alpha and Soul Seekers.

Kevin Chung, 19, whois the hos-
pitalities leader for Cornerstone at
Pitt, said the event proved successful
in bringing different groups together.

“It’s just not so good that every-
one’s so segregated,” he said.

Many people in attendance, such
as Robert Morris College freshman
Tom Dixon, repeated the phrase

~_“God is awesome”, throughout the
ﬁgnight. A . ~
 “We know there’s a lot of mis-

Eiigconceptions about Christianity. It’s .

ifgnot _a religious thing, it’s a relation-
féship with God,” Dixon said, adding
}-that he felt the event showed that
f7 there are many different ways to wor-
-fl ship. '

 Rob Blodgett, 19, who attends

'5; Indiana University of Pennsylvania,
 came to the event with four other IUP
1; students. Blodgett said he” was thank-
fﬂful that the event could even take
place.

 .“If we came together like this in
other.countries, we would all be
3‘ arrested, because Christians are so
_’-_a;f hated,” he said. “We take. our free-
f?.‘dom here for granted.” ‘

‘ Dave Auger, a Pitt student who
organize the Christian
 Meeting, announced that he and his
59 friends had posted nearly 400 fliers
around campus to advertise the event.
;.%But, Auger said, someone wrote
 “Satan” on several of the fliers.
 Auger said he thought the graffiti
:;%"'shows what a desperate state the
ffjcampus is in- A

 He asked the audience, “I see this
';§-"vision where the University ~ of
 Pittsburgh becomes more Christian
than secular. Is that possible?”

for Christianity to reach Pitt students.
I believeathis is a matter of life
and death — not physical, but spiritu-

_ But he finds the campus is slowly
growing more Christian.

Auger said he believes Pitt would
be a better place if more students
were Christians. 9

“The campus would be more

be provided through altruism. A lot
less violence. I could go on and on.”

Should the CIA kill bin Laden?

It’s been longstanding American pol-
icy not to carry out political assassina-
tions. But the Sept. 11 attacks have
changed things. -

According to‘ the Oct. 21 Washington

Post, a month ago President George W."

Bush ordered the CIA to do “whatever
necessary” to kill Osama bin Laden, the
believed mastermind of the attacks, and
destroy his organization, al Qaeda.

On the surface, this appears to be a
change in policy.

During the early Cold War, the CIA
tried to kill enemy foreign leaders, such
as Cuba’s Fidel Castro. But in response to
criticism about bungled attempts and the
righteousness of killing foreign leaders
without direct provocation, President
Gerald Ford signed an executive order
prohibiting political assassinations.
Every president since has renewed this
order.

As a general policy, the United States
should not be killing foreign leaders. But
specific circumstances, such as the
attacks of Sept. 11, can warrant the use of
assassination as a tool of international
politics. _

Almost immediately after ’ the
attacks, Bush referred to them as an act of
war. His administration’s attorneys told
The Washington Post that the assassina-
tion ban does not apply to wartime.
Indeed, wartime attacks against enemy
leaders are commonplace.

When a country is attacked, it has a
right of response under international law.
Acceptable retaliation can include the
leaders of the attack,_ whether they are
leaders of a country or of an organization.

Self-defense also serves as a valid
justification for Bush’s order. The CIA
already received what it considers credi-
ble threats against the United States.
Assassinating the alleged mastermind of
previous attacks could do a great deal to
prevent future ones.

Should the CIA be successful in ﬁnd-
ing and assassinating bin Laden and
some of his top-ranking henchmen, it
could be a victory in the war on terrorism.

The organization would lose not only
its symbolic ﬁgurehead but also a signif-
icant source of its funding, thus making
any of its potential operations less effec-
tive. . '

Although bin Laden’s demise would

likely make. him a martyr and recruit

more people to his cause, it could also
create a power vacuum — and potential

power struggle-— within al Qaeda, severe- '

ly weakening the organization and mak-
ing it much easier to destroy.

While the United States tried before
to kill bin Laden, it never had a reason as
compelling as this one. If faced with a
choice between letting bin Laden escape
or killing him, the United States should
not hesitate to do the latter. Otherwise, we
may regret it in the ﬁxture.

THE PITT NEWS

An official unofficial survival guide for freshmen

Freshman men, this one goes out to
you. Now that you’ve come to know
your surroundings a little better, it is
time for me to release to you the
“Official Unofficial Pitt Survival Guide
for Fresh Fish.” Compliments of my
guide, you will learn of the many fasci-
nating intricacies that make this
University unique. .

My regrets to the freshman ladies,
but I’d be doing you a great disservice if

I tried to write about subject matters —

like ... you know, periods —

If this year is anything like the past,
I’m sure the Ashtray is still holding very
loud late—night meetings. You should
understand, though, that these irritating
and inconsiderate people are actually
recruited from the top Schools for the
Annoying from across the country and
are given full scholarships so that they
can bother everyone trying to sleep in
the Towers and Holland Hall.

“Why? What the hell kind of ridicu-
lous crap is that?” you ask. Listen, three
of my best men died trying

that I know nothing about.
But if you feel left out, you
can make fun of my skinny
chicken legs to feel better.
Surely, the first thing on
a manboy’s mind when he
matriculates at college is the
course description guide — I

you have already noticed,

going away.

ladies, and, because of this,

you should be careful not to strain your
neck. Even in my long tenure here I
haven’t gotten used to all the scorching
hotties at Pitt — especially that scrump-
tious Pitt News copy editor who loves
playing hard to get. Hey Karen: do me

i already.

But don’t worry. You won’t get to
hook up with any of these fine speci-
mens of whackable gorgeousness — no
matter how many of them you tell

’ you’re one of the Ruff Ryders. Believe

me, I know.

Still, girls love cute stuff. This is
epitomized when some stud shows up at
the Ashtray with his puppy. Before Lil’
Wayne can finish saying “Drop it like
it’s hot,” a horde of girls bulrushes the

, dog lover as if that mutt was Justin

“Tearin’ up My Heart” Timberlake.

What does this teach you? Outdo ’

that guy and find a baby. Within min-

- . utes you, my friend, will be making real

babies, if you know what I mean. I
mean you’ll be having sex. with human

V women. Still don’t get it? Go ask your

mother.

Moving on, when talk-
ing to your parents, it’s considered total-
ly uncool to discuss anything but get-
ting more money. Anyone overheard
saying “I love you mommy” will be
beaten mercilessly with a crowbar.

And don’t forget to bring a ﬂash-
light if you’re going to the Cathedral
commons room. They haven’t gotten
around to installing lights there.

Also, guys, it’s common-courtesy to
offer your male professors felatio here

at Pitt. This might sound a little weird, '

but it’s one of our oldest traditions and
if you don’t do it, your teacher will get
very offended.

’ You’re probably "wondering why
you have to pay for your laundry after
throwing _thousands of dollars at the
University. Housing services has deep
rooted emotional problems and this is
the only way it can show it loves you.
So please, take their love — its weird,
crappy love.

All the previous stuff was impor-
tant, but merely aniappetizer compared
to the most vital part of the freshman

' social experience — partying. And by

right now. This evil society“

because this gig is bigger '

partying, I mean drinking too much.
When arriving at a party, the cus-
tom is to do 20 jumping jacks,
smash a tomato on your fore-

head, drop your pants and do

a little dance. After you pay
with a monkey’s'
brain, you should
offer one of the guys
who lives’ there fela-

t1o.
Once you’ve
entered, you should try
really hard to drink as K x

much as you can, especial-

ly while you’re young and
stupid. A usual faux pas
freshmen commit is drinking
less than 10 beers. If you do,
you will be mocked horri-
bly, with a 78 percent
chance of receiving a

wedgie.

After you’ve
become totally t-

But for the rest of us familiar with
activities like eating, tight clothes are
not always the way to go.

It seems advertising companies‘

never sat down together to figure out
how to seduce us into spending our

competing with each other to sell it to

with the name so you’d like it-better
than anyone else’s.

Don’t worry, we’re not the first
generation to get suckered. In the
1950s, companies hired pollsters and
statistic experts to gather data on

housewives, the new spending power.
Finding most of these women bored
out of their minds, they marketed
their vacuum cleaners and washing
machines to convince housewives
that these products would bring
meaning to their lives. And house-
wives bought into it to the point that,
even after they bought the vacuum
cleaner and it didn’t do anything but
clean the rug," they ‘still ran to the

store for the next miracle product‘

‘Philly’s Coolest Actress’

cooks while she works

Mondo Mangia
Through Nov. 18
City Theatre
(412) 431-CITY
7k'2§*£‘r1/2

NANCY REDDY
Staff Writer

Ranging from silly to serious to downright ridicu-
lous, “Mondo Mangia” is like being invited into the
kitchen of a wildly entertaining but slightly nuttyr next-
door neighbor. She’s interesting, she’s eager to please,
but you never know what she's going to do next.

Song, dance, conversation and good Italian food
—— what more could you ask for in a night out?

The 90-minute one-woman show passes as
quicldy as time spent in good conversation with an old
friend. Jilline Ringle’s high-energy performance
keeps the audience engaged. Musical director Jason
Coll’s piano playing and occasional interruptions pro-
vide an enjoyable soundtrack.

Ringle, recently named “Philly’s Coolest Actress” ’

by the Philadelphia City Paper, created and stars in
“Mondo Mangia.” Her sense of family history and tra-
dition, expressed through food, is central to the show.
She begins the show with a prayer to the “kitchen god-
desses,” her mother, grandmother and great-grand-

mother, in whose kitchens she learned to cook.
Ringle’s impressive stage ' presence commands
the audience’s attention from the very beginning; Full
of songs and great stories, she really is the ultimate
hostess. From the way‘ she talks about her family --
from “Big Sal” to her grandmother who bakes 35-
pound lasagnas for engagement parties‘ _— the audi-
ence quickly feels as if it is a part of this huge and lov-
ing, though at times odd, family. ‘ ~
The set -— a ‘60s style kitchen adorned with
rosaries, pictures of the pope and other religious
objects representing Ringle’s Catholic upbringing —
is simple but completely ﬁtting for the show. Ringle
puts the kitchen to good use, cooking a delicious din-

ner for the audience as she talks. Coll sitsat his ‘piano ,
just offstage, far enough to not distractfrom Ringle’s A

performance, but close enough to be involved in some
of the action. T

Although the songs can be schmaltzy at times,
like “Mamma,” an ode to Ringle’s mother as well as
the rest of her female ancestors, more lighthearted
parts of the show balance it out. “Sick 0 Chicken” is
a hilarious mock-rap that features Ringle wearing
gold chains and a gold-plated spoon around her neck
like an Italian Mr. T.

Vlfrthout preaching, Ringle also touches on more
serious issues. The song “I Don’t Wantato GetT_hi_n”
expresses her refusal to embrace the hyper-thin female

ideal oftoday. She says, “Food is love -3-iandygﬁliifeed A --

the soul by feeding the body.” __

Near the end of the show, Ringle serves ._tl:§_e entire
audience a portion of the delicious food she"
during the course of the show. “Mondo l\r_Iangija’_.;"isi' a

Downtown Pittsburgh doesn’t seem like the subject
of a landscape painting. Smokestacks, skyscrapers and
graffiti—covered billboards shape the landscape — not
rolling green hills and bridgeless rivers.

The University Art Gal1ery’s exhibit, “Representing
Western Pennsylvania: Three Centuries of Landscape
Painting,” illustrates that landscape painting has evolved
with the city over the years.

The exhibit features work-of artists spanning three
centuries. From rural farms to urban industrial centers,
the paintings show how human presence has affected the
landscape of Western Pennsylvania. Many of the paint-
ings in this exhibit come from private collections and

Sculptor draws from history

Elie Nadelman: Classical Folk
Through Dec. 30

Frick Art Museum
www.frickart.org

HEATHER BOWLAN
Senior Staff Writer

One can easily observe that our culture looks to‘ the
past for guidance, for inspiration, for a perspective not
found in the immediate surroundings. This is especially
true of modern art. Our century’s most innovative artists
— such as Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dali — started
off by imitating the work of their predecessors. The past
is perhaps our most valuable teacher, even if what it
teaches us is not to repeat its mistakes.

Looking at the sculptures and drawings of Elie
Nadelman, one can’t help ﬁnding the past The Frick Art
Museum’s exhibition includes works from Nade1rnan’s
American period, 1914-1946, during which time classic
and contemporary art inﬂuenced him. The classic inﬂu-
ence is much more apparent, but not necessarily
N adelrnan’s beneﬁt. ‘

One ﬁrst encounters work from the artist’s classic
period, and the sign indicating this is almost superﬂuous.
Pieces like “Woman’s Head (Goddess),” a marble sculp-
ture from 1916, clearly show the Greek inﬂuence by the
thin, pointed nose and passive look.

Nearby are pieces depicting dancers and perform-
ers, the most interesting of these is “Two Circus
Women,” a large plaster and papier—mache construction.

OAKLAND FASHION SOi5i‘1cAL
311 sourrr CRAIG smear

The two women. one sitting with legs spread, the other
standing with one leg crossed over the other, have no fea-
tures other than their curves and.their long, curly hair,
which merges into their backs.

Nadelman is perhaps most noted for his incorpora-
tion of folk art into his work. One can certainly see the
inﬂuence in the simple sculptures, made out of more
earthy substances. For instance, the woman in “Seated
Woman” is made out ofcheny wood, and is seated on a
colonial—looking iron chair. This sculpture, too, lacks par-
ticular features, although the contrast of the wood and the
iron is quite striking.

Last are Nadelman’s late works; these are mostly
small (not more than seven inches tall) porcelain ﬁg-
urines of girls in various poses. The museum literally dis-
plays dozens of them, and the detail on each varies.

But perhaps the most intriguing and detailed piece

~ in the exhibit is Nadelman’s last completely sculpted

head, “Head of Baudelaire,” referring to the 19th centu-
ry poet who Nadelman considered an inspiration. The
piece, made of white marble, has wide and unseeing
eyes with no ‘details of iris or pupils, a characteristically
thin, straight nose, small ears and a large, smooth, bald
head.

It’s interesting that the last image one has at this
exhibit is that of Charles Baudelaire, a poet who,
although Romantic in his technique, was fearless in his
portrayal of subjects -7 one poem of his, "To the
Reader,” condemns the cultivated boredom of the bour-
geoisie. ~ .

9 One might be tempted to see this fearlessness in
Nadelman’s work, in his use of the art of the Everyman,
in his ﬂamboyant portrayals of his subjects“. Butfinstead
the art feels hollow; his featureless renditions often seem
like inhuman caricatures. 1
Unfortunately, Nadelman’s art does not resonate

» with the present. We should leave him to the past.

DIANA MOFFO
Staff Writer

While Boston may be known for the bar where every-
body knows your name, a certain famous tea party and a Mr.
Adams with a penchant for brewing a damn ﬁne ale, there
is a treasure to be found on the outskirts of Beantown.

“Southie” — the name even sounds like the wrong side
of the tracks. V

Matt Damon and Ben Affleck introduced us to the

rough-talking, beer—guzzling, hard—working neighborhood

in their 1997 ﬁlm “Good Will Hunting.” Sure, there are
parts of Southie that reﬂect that image, but the small town is
more like your Aunt Ethel’s blueberry pie: a little crusty
around the edges, but full of sweetness and warmth.

The charm of Southie lies in the small family—owned
businesses that line the cobblestone streets.
Peppered among the skinny row houses and
rowdy Irish pubs are ‘quaint delis, like
Tenie’s Place. The comer restaurant seats 20,
customers at the most and serves hearty Irish
breakfasts.

The line for the deli starts inside and reaches around the
comer of the building. Three men in their.'70s, all ‘wearing
wool golﬁng caps and button-down pea coats, stand hud-
dled together outside. \V1th hands stuffed inside their pock-
ets and collars ﬂipped up to shield out the cold air, the men
discuss the quickest way to get to downtown Boston.

“Ya take the T to Pack Street and walk don to the gov..
a’ mem centa,” explainsone in a typical ‘Southie accent.

“Aye, I agree, Tom,” says another in a brogue thicker
than Irish stew. ‘

R _ sausage links, rye toast dripping with butter and
Carafes of orange juice ﬁll the table, along with

to  a local favorite. , -

The three men live close to the deli and go there often
for coffee and conversation. Other Boston residents take the
subway, the T, "to Southie to experience the down—home side
ofthecity. ’ i I "

Four Harvard boys with slick out of their A

booth, leave a generous tip for the waitress and slip out the
door, leaving a trace of spicy cologne in their path to mix
with the already greasy smell of the deli.

The waitress, a fresh-scrubbed woman of 30 with a
pencil behind her ear and a notepad in her hand, throws the
tip in the glass jar on the counter and leads the three men to
the table the boys just left V

“What’l1 it be, Tom? Black and white pudding today?”
she says, her wispy auburn hair falling in hereyes. Tom
nods, hands her the menu, and adds, “A black coffee, too,
Irene.” ‘  7.  j ; _ 5 - A . .

Ten minutes later, Irene hands the men
their breakfasts. Salty scrambled eggs, steamy

Tom’s black and white pudding.

Of course, not all customers are known by name
and face at the deli —— yet. A young couple, Dan and
Sylvia, just moved _to Southie from San Francisco for
Sylvia’s new job as an union organizer. The two. sit
across from the men eating their pudding, which is
‘anything but. ‘

‘.‘Excuse me, what is that exactly?” asks Dan, eager’

To say that anything in a David
Lynch ﬁlm is “weir ” is by now not only

understood but, well, normal. From.

“Eraserhead” to “Blue Velvet,” Lynch has
never been’known to adhere to cinematic
convention, a trait that makes a touching-
ly pensive ﬁlm like 1999’s “The. Straight
Story” strange if only by association. But
Hollywood has always been on his mind,

though usually by way of subversion.

His latest ﬁlm, “Mulholland Drive,”
is no exception .— we’re shown yet
another variation on what’s come before
in the Lynchian oeuvre: a fantastical, per-
verted, Freudian and indeed perpetually
weird cinemascape of surreal modernity.

The ﬁlm opens in a retro—styled pre-
senteday Hollywood, complete with star-
lets, detectives and joyriders.

The many stories running through the

_film include a mysterious amnesiac

(Laura Elena Harring) who’s apparently
caught up in some dirty dealings; an
arriving actress with stars in her eyes
named Bettie (Naomi Watts), who tries to
help mystery girl ﬁgure out her past; and
hot young director Adam Kesher (Justin
Theroux), who ﬁnds that maybe he’s not
in charge of his next ﬁlm.

If you’ve got these straight, then
you’re on the wrong track.

In the vein of 1996’s “Lost
Highway,” Lynch explores, to some
effect, the conflict between identity and
imagination, which ﬁts nicely into a story

 

'  about actors in the land of artiﬁciality.

Furthermore, Lynch created
“Mulholland” with the format of “Twin
Peaks” in mind as he attempted to draw
out yet another bizarro serial drama. But

ABC nixed the idea, and Lynch found “

himself stuck with what we see here, pre-
sumably the pilot episode. ’

' And with so many divergent plotlines
going off to establish themselves for the
proposed ongoing series, the ﬁnal half
hour of rnind—boggling identity switches
simply adds up to Lynch tacking on an
ending to what was intended as only the
beginning. _

Granted, Lynch’s attempt to undercut
the glam of tinsel town with the general
screwiness of its inhabitants is interesting
in some instances. ,

But his decidedly‘ unsubtle comment
on showbiz as a prefab facade isn’t exact-
ly groundbreaking; it’s the stuff they
teach you in Film Analysis 101, that
everything placed on the screen is there
for a very speciﬁc reason.

In the end, Lynch makes a mess,
albeit a potentially intriguing one. But in
the obviousness of trying to pass off a
television show’s origin’ as a complete
ﬁlm, he has created a narrative incoheren—
cy and impenetrability that doesn’t have
the sort of surreal, iconographic connec-
tion that his past ﬁlms’ truly strange
moments have had. J I

, Its ﬁnale may seem provocatively
weird and shocking, but “Mulholland”
falls ﬂat in the end by taking the cheap
way, despite the illusion, toward closure.

from a band that reﬂects a “live and let live” attitude.

Wonders of the World is as colorful and diverse
as the members themselves. Each member has a dif-

Brothers Band to hard—core rap to improvisational
jazz. More like a family than a band, most of the

Many of the current Allstars made their first

Sublime’s fusion of black rhythms and reggae with

~ Does a 60s—style ir1die—pop trio signed to major label Foodchain
Records, after only ﬁve live perfonnances, actually have a future in
music? Well, that’s Iffy. -
To decide for yourself, see them Monday when the band plays
the South Side’s Club Cafe. »
Out _of Minneapolis, Iffy mixes a style of pop,- rock, hip-hop,
fusion, techno and a pinch of disco into one eclectic album, curious-
ly titled Biota Bondo. Singer and fnontman Kirk J ohnson’s captivat-—.

ing voice has a style that varies between that of the lead singers of r

Sublime and Cake. _
But if the album itself was as original andvibrant as the artwork
on the cover, Iffy might actually have a long career in music to look
forward to. _ .
The opening track, “Double Dutch,” starts the album on an
upbeat note, although the intro sounds remarkably similar to

, Everclear’s‘ “AM Radio?’ with Sugar Ray as a guest artist But the

catchy beat and easy-to-remember chorus might be enough to snag
a following of Top 40 fans, and makes this one of the more appeal-
ing songs on the album. . '
“The Citation” hints at an inﬂuence of hip-hop, while “Can 0
Cope” and “Da Blink” provide tastes of techno and dance that

One thing that Biota Bondo does not lack is a variety of musi- S

cal accessories; In “Georgina,” strains of a ﬂute emerge from

beneath the overlay of bass and drums. The clink of a woodblock ‘

resonates in the intro of “Larva Rae” and returns forthe last few bars
of the tune. And in “Double Dutch,” the innocent voices of children
accompany the band during a chorus.

Additionally, record scratching, high—pitched screams, vocals
chanted instead of sung and the use of a lap steel guitar all contribute
to giving Iffy a unique sound with music that might otherwise be‘
considered run—of-the—rnill.

VV1th all of the idiosyncrasies present in Iffy’s style though, one "

would think that Biota Bondo would have a sound that transcends
modern pop—rock monotony. But for each unique element, there
seems to be another aspect present that simply reminds you of some-

Rich history of
linebackers in
steel town

"851-ollrrs vim

Joe Marchilena

Throughout the 1990s, the Pittsburgh
Steelers lost numerous free agentsiduring

‘ every off-season. Year after year, the rest of

the NFL dissected the Steelers’ roster while
Bill_Cowher and his staff continued to. ﬁll in
the holes through the draft.

_ _ Until a few years ago, this method con-
tinued to work perfectly for the Steelers.
Every year, Cowher found suitable replace-
ments for all of those who left the team,

A ‘ especially at the linebacker position.

» Now Pittsburgh is back on top of the
AFC A Central with a 4-1 record after
Sunday’s win over Tampa Bay. One of the
main reasons for the team’s success is its
linebackers.

No matter how many linebackers the
Steelers lost, there was always someone to
step in and master the position.

It’s almost an unwritten legacy that
Pittsburgh has had since the 1970s, when
Andy Russell, Jack Ham and Jack Lambert
manned’ the middle of the Steelers’ 4-3
defense. T

Since Cowher became the head coach
in 1992, the Steelers have played a 3-4
defense. That defense has produced six Pro
Bowl linebackers and, this year, could pos-
sibly send three more to Hawaii.

How does Cowher consistently ﬁnd
guys who can play the position so well? Do

the Steelers get lucky in drafting the right '

guys? Or maybe it’s because they’ve draft-

A ed so many linebackers since Cowher took

over for Chuck Noll after the 1991 season.

Since'Cowher’s ﬁrst draft in 1992, the -

Steelers drafted l6 linebackers. The only
other position with more than 10 draft picks
is at wide receiver, where Pittsburgh draft-
ed 13. Unfortrmately, the team has not been
quite as successful with those picks.

Pitt football’s 2001 campaign con-
tinued its nosedive by being completely
dominated by Boston College, 45-7.

After silencing the Boston College
Alumni Stadium crowd with a six—play,
80-yard touchdown drive to open the
game, Pitt failed to match Boston
College in any facet of the game, giving
up 45 unanswered points. The loss was
Pitt’s fifth consecutive, and it has yet to
defeat a Division I—A school.

But when the game mercifully con-
cluded, the focus did not revolve around '
one distinct problem as a dejected head
coach Walt Harris came to realize that
there is a plethora of serious problems
within the program that mustbe dealt
with. A

“If I had all of the answers, I
wouldn’t be sitting here feeling the way
I do,” Harris said during his postgame
press conference. “I feel empty, disap-
pointed, bad for ‘our players, coaches
and bad for all of the people that sup-
port us.”

Harris said that after the game he
had an unusual locker room talk with '
his team, ‘one that included a serious

“They’re off until Tuesday. Our
guys need some time to decide what
they’re going to do,” he said. “Are they
with us or aren’t they? The ones that are

going to show up on Tuesday have been_

instructed to show up with the attitude

Harris" continued, “I told them that
they’re not welcome if they’re not
ready. The ones that feel it will have
some time to take a look at_themselves
and‘ decide.” A

The talk came after a game that saw
the defense give up 498 total yards and
an offense that was ineffective for well
beyond three quarters.

Priestley completed 11 of 21 passes for
just 80 yards and two interceptions.
Antonio Bryant ﬁnished the game with
a team-high three receptions for 21
yards. Running back Ray Kirkley tore
off a 57-yard run in the opening drive,
but finished the game with 85 yards on

It’s third and 8 from Pitt’s own 38-yard line. The
Panthers have a 7-0 lead and everything is going as
planned.‘ , ‘ _ ' '

Then Priestley goes back to pass and the ball is inter-
cepted by Josh Ott. Immediately, the Pitt fans in the stands
sense that this is the beginning of the end.

Saturday’s game against Boston College marked’ the
third consecutive "game in which David Priestley threw two
interceptions. A

In each game, his miscues have become turning points
in games that were close until a big interception.
Priestley’s passes have been fruitless, leaving Pitt’s star
wide receiver Antonio Bryant with less than 100 receiving
yards in each game this season. .

Priestley’s mistakes hurt Pitt again

“I keep shooting us in the foot,” Priestley said.'“It’s a
struggle. Maybe it does affectmy confidence.” .

Saturday was no different. The first interception
Priestley threw completely changed the outcome of the
game. After taking a 7-0 lead, without a pass attempt (six
straight rushes for 75 yards), the Pitt defense held Boston
College and forced a punt.

On the ensuing drive, Priestley completed a 19-yard

‘pass to R.-J. English. His ﬁrst attempt of thegame would

turn out to be Priestley’s best pass of the game.

back topass and threw behind Bryant. The ball was tipped

of the year, and from that point on, the Eagles dominated

Loss, page 13

Leading 7-0, Pitt faced a third down and 8 on
its second possession. Priestley saw a streaking
Bryant, who was coming over the middle, but
Priestley double—pumped and the ball was
telegraphed and intercepted by the Eagles’ Josh
Ott.

Boston. College would capitalize_ on its next
drive behind strong running from William Green
and a 26-yard reception by Dedrick DeWalt. The
game-tying drive was capped off with a 3-yard
quick-out touchdown pass from Brian St. Pierre to
Jamal Burke. ‘

The game took a turn for the worse for Pitt at
the 2 minute, 57 second mark when Pitt was
forced to punt at its own 23-yard line. Punter Andy
Lee shanked the ball off the right side of his foot,
sending the ball just 18 yards.

After the poor punts set Boston College up
with great field position, Green did all of the work
for Boston College, carrying the ball ﬁve times for
41 yards, scoring the touchdown that put them up
for good, at 14-7.

On Pitt’s next drive, Priestley tried to go deep
to Bryant but underthrew him and was intercepted.
Two drives later, Green scored again, this time
running for 38 yards on four carries. Green wasn’t
touched on his 12-yard touchdown run that put his
team ahead, 21-7.

“When things go bad, we’re not in the mindset
to overcome that,” Harris said. “We’ve gotten our
butts kicked a couple of times and we’ve had trou-

ble coming back.”

Green ran all over the Pitt defense, finishing
the game with 182 yards on 29 carries. With his
combination of speed and ‘hard running, Green
scored three times.

Harris noted that Green was probably the most
dominant offensive player that Pitt has faced this
season. V

Boston College went on to score two more
times in the first half as it went into halftime with
a commanding 35-7 lead. After the first drive,
Pitt’s offense never threatened to score as Priestley
overthrew and underthrew the ball to receivers all
day," and Kirkley had trouble finding holes to run
through.

“We’re going to look at the tape and see who’s
laying it on the line,” Harris said. “We’l1 see who
is responding to coaching and who is not, and
hopefully we have enough guys to take the place
of the guys who’ve decided to go in their own
direction.” '

Harris knows that the players have a lot of
pressure on their shoulders because of the early
season expectations that were probably unrealistic.

“Part of the problem is how we disappointed
everyone and my challenge is to keep us driving,
while we’ve disappointed so many people,” he
said. “The truth of the matter is, I think that we’re
not what people thought we were. Right now we
have personnel things that we need to square
away.”

Pitt’s next game is Saturday against Temple in
Philadelphia. '

Priestley totals 80 yards

Priestley, page 13 ‘

Even though Priestley’s first interception was the turn-
ing point of the game, he had his chances to redeem his
first mistake. But Priestley continued to falter, leaving
Pitt’s defense scrambling to get back onto the field.

“Our defense wasn’t given support by the offense,”
head coach Walt Harris said.

With 52 seconds remaining in the first quarter and Pitt
down 14-7, the Panthers took over on offense at their own
26-yard.line. On the first play, Priestley went back to pass
and overthrew Bryant by at least 15 yards.

Bryant ran an in pattern from the right sideline and
ended up alone at the Pitt 45 on the left hash mark. Bryant
jumped to pull down Priestley’s rising ﬂoater, but all
Bryant came down with was anger and disgust and anoth-
er blown opportunity. If the pass was on target, Bryant
could have scored. ' ‘

After a roughing the_passer call on Boston College, a

9-yard pass to Lamar Slade and a 4-yard run from Rod .

Rutherford, Pitt had a drive going. at midfield. The
Panthers then decided to take a gamble to go deep.

Bryant went streaking down the left sideline, but when
he looked «up for the ball, Boston College’s Peter Shean
had already intercepted the well underthrown high-fly ball.
It was Priestle_y’s second pick of the game and another
momentum and drive killer. '

“Never in my worst nightmares did I think it would be
like this now,” Priestley said.

At halftime, Priestley was three for nine with two A
interceptions- and only 26 yards passing. The second half ‘

wasn’t much better, when both Rutherford and third string
quarterback Pat Hoderney replaced Priestley. Priestley
ended the day 11 for 22 with two interceptions and only 80
total yards.

good group of linebackers in his first year.
Veterans David Little and Brian I-linkle led
the Steelers’ defense along with future Pro
Bowlers Hardy Nickerson and Greg Lloyd.

Nickerson eventually left Pittsburgh
after Cowher’s first season for Tampa Bay.
Lloyd stuck around for a few more years,
collecting 53 1/2 sacks while becoming one
of the NFL’s most feared players.

Kevin Greene joined Lloyd in 1993
and was the Steelers only signiﬁcant free
agent acquisition in the early 1990s. Two
young linebackers also joined him on the
inside. Chad Brown and Levon Kirkland

THE PITT NEWS

Lambert, Lloyd, Holmes among greats

emerged as the best inside linebackers in the

game, while Lloyd and Greene turned into
the best pass-rushing duo of the early
1990s. .

But by 1997, Kirkland was the only
one left. Jason Gildon, a 1994 draft pick,
took over for Greene in 1996 and has
recorded 77 sacks during his eight-year
career. In the middle, Earl Holmes, selected
in the fourth round in 1996, replaced Brown
in 1997 and led the team in tackles every
year since. -

It took a little longer to ﬁnd someone
that could wreak havoc on an offense the
way Lloyd did, but since he entered the
league in 1999, Joey Porter has shown plen-

ty of reasons why he can be that player.

Look at Sunday’s win over the
Buccaneers as an example. Porter led the
defense in harassing Brad Johnson, record-
ing four of the team’s 10 sacks.

Not every linebacker has turned into a
Pro Bowl caliber player though. For every
Holmes and Gildon, there has been a Rico
Mack and a Chad Kelsay. _

The current group, which also includes
rookie Kendrell Bell, has become the great-
est group of linebackers the NFL has seen,
since its predecessors. '
