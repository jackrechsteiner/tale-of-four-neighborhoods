E—mail is becoming an endan-
gered communication vehicle,
some computer industry experts
say, because _users increasingly
are so turned off by unsolicited
messages they are avoiding e—mail
entirely.

But Pitt has done something
about the annoying, omnipres-
ent bulk e—mail known as spam.
VVhile employees and students
were sleeping last Saturday, Pitt’s
Computing Services and Systems
Development (CSSD) personnel
installed a new spam and virus

Industry estimates project that
40 — 80 percent of the more than
40 billion e-mails sent worldwide
daily are spam.

But what constitutes spam is
in the eye of the beholder. So Pitt
has purchased software that ﬂags
spam but does not immediately
delete it, allowing users two
weeks to judge for themselves,
according to CSSD director
Jinx Walton.

The new service, which also
is designed to protect Pitt users
against e—mail viruses, is the prod-
uct of Postini, Inc., a California-
based provider of e—mail security
and management solutions that

preventing spam and virus attacks
from reaching an enterprise gate-

well, Walton said, something tha
requires the ﬁlters to be installed
on department servers.)

E-mails suspected of being
spam or containing a virus
are “quarantined” in the main
window of the user’s “Message
Center,” a gadget  that can
be accessed through my.pitt.edu.
(My.pitt.edu is the University’s
web portal service that allows
Pitt users to customize their view
of the University’s various web
sites and services in addition to
commonly used Intemet—based
services.)

Once connected, the message
center is linked uniquely to the

user’s portal home page, known as
“My Page.” Thus, messages quar-
antined in the message center are
secure, that is, accessible only by
the authorized user or a message
center administrator.

The e—mail addressee is noti-
ﬁed by the ﬁltering service that
an incoming e—mail is suspicious.
(See sidebar on page 4.) Messages
remain in the message center
for 14 days and then are deleted
automatically.

“No [filtering] system is
foolproof,” Walton acknowl-
edged. “We carefully evaluated
all of these solutions that were
out there. Some solutions did

period. It notiﬁes you that spam
is there, and it ﬁlters for viruses
too. During that two weeks,
you can view your messages in
the message center and forward
any messages you want to keep
directly to your inbox, or you
can delete them from there,”
Walton said. “It’s fairly intuitive
and straightforward to use.”
The quarantine function
allows users to open messages
with suspected viruses in the
message center without danger
of spreading the virus to their
computer, she added.

UNIVERSITY TIMES

Expedited faculty grievance
procedure to be adopted

itt facultywith grievances

P against their administra-

tors or colleagues soon

will have a new, expedited pro-
cedure for seeking redress.

The new process —— the result
of several years of off-and—on
talks between the Provost’s ofﬁce
and an ad hoc University Senate
committee —— will be available to
full- and part-time faculty and
faculty librarians as a speeded—
up alternative to Pitt’s regular
grievance procedure.

Both the expedited and
regular procedures are intended
for grievances not speciﬁcally
covered by University policies
on sexual harassment, racial dis-
crimination, negative evaluations
of a faculty member’s professional
work and dissatisfaction with
individual salary decisions.

“For example,” Vice Pro-
vost for Faculty Affairs Andrew
R. Blair explained, “if faculty
members feel that they’re being
treated unfairly in terms of teach-
ing assignments, or that their pro-
fessional work is suffering as the
result of what they believe to be a
hostile work environment, these

[expedited and regular] grievance
procedures would apply. The
procedures are meant to cover
a wide range of actions and
decisions that faculty members
believe have adversely affected
their professional development,
but which are not covered by
other existing policies.” .

Senate Council unanimously
endorsed the expedited grievance
procedure June 7, but Council
actions are advisory only. How-
ever, Provost James V. Maher,
who serves on the Council
along with Chancellor Mark
A. Nordenberg and other Pitt
administrators, conﬁrmed after
the meeting that the administra-
tion will indeed offer the expe-
dited procedure as an alternative
to the regular one.

Former Senate president
Nathan Hershey, who chaired
the ad hoc committee on the
expedited review process, said an
accelerated process was needed
because, under the regular pro-
cedure, some cases have dragged
on to the point that complainants
had left Pitt before their griev-

ances were resolved.

John L. “Jack” Kams

John L. “Jack” Karns, a profes-
sor, department chair and attor-
ney who taught criminal justice
and legal studies courses at Pitt

Kams had been hospitalized
recently with heart problems and

International Affairs (GSPIA),
where Kams was an associate
professor and director of the

affairs division. »

department, “was an incredible

sor and undergraduate division
director at GSPIA. “He was a
visionary — he built the admin-
istration of justice and legal stud-
ies programs in the College of
General Studies” (CGS), which
annually enrolled more than 900
undergraduates and 50 graduate
students, and employed 10 full-
time and 21 part-time faculty
members. In 1987, the program
moved to GSPIA.

Paralyzed by a neckinjury suf-
fered in a high school wrestling
match, Kams put other people
at ease about his disability and
didn’t allow it to stop him from
pursuing his career in academics,
consulting and the law, according
to Weinberg.

After serving at Pitt as a senior
teaching associate in sociology,
Kams was promoted in 1972 from
acting director to director of the
administration of justice program
in CGS. He directed that pro-
gram, as well as the Department
of Interdisciplinary Studies in
Law andJustice, until 1987. From

1987 to 1989, he was director and
associate professor in GSPIA’s law
and justice concentration.

In addition to serving as a
professor and administrator in
GSPIA from the late 1980s to
2004, Kams was a consultant for
a number of government agencies
including the Allegheny County
public defender’s office (2001-
04), the International Manage-

ment Development Institute in
Djakarta, Indonesia (1993 and
1994) and the Commonwealth
of the Bahamas (1989-90).

Karns earned all of his aca-
demic degrees —— including a
J.D., Ph.D. and M.A. degrees in
sociology, and a B.A. in political
science — from Pitt.

He is survived by his wife,
Margaret E. Karns, and a
daughter.

——Bruce Steele I

One reason for this, Her-
shey and Provost Maher agreed,
is that it’s sometimes difficult
to coordinate the schedules of
faculty members who serve on
three—member grievance panels.
Also, some cases are especially
complex and time-consurning
to investigate.

The expedited procedure will
offer faculty the option of having
their grievances investigated by
a single hearing ofﬁcer selected
by the provost in consultation

with the Senate president (and,
if the faculty member is from
the Health Sciences, the senior
vice chancellor for Health Sci-
ences). ,

If dissatisfied with the
provost’s choice of a hearing
ofﬁcer, the faculty member seek-
ing redress has ﬁve days to opt
instead for the regular grievance
procedure.

Under both systems, investi-
gators report their recommenda-
tions for resolving the grievance
to the provost, Whose subsequent
ruling completes the process.

Under the regular procedure,
a panel of three faculty members
(chosen from among the elected
members of Faculty Assembly)
considers a grievance.

Provost Maher said: “The

problem with the regular process
is that if the faculty who serve on
the grievance panels are not able
to drop everything and work on
nothing else, the process can take
a while.”

Maher called the regular
grievance process “a good one”
and “the appropriate process
for ahnost all of the faculty.” He
said one reason it took so long for
Senate leaders and the Provost’s
office to agree on an expedited
procedure “is that I wanted to
make sure that any expedited
process will not in any way
undermine the existing one.”

Typically, only one or two
faculty members a year use the
grievance procedure, Maher
said.

that emergency crews from the

District of Columbia, Maryland

and Virginia had communicating
with one another in the wake of
the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon.

Better communication technolo-

gies represent just one research-

and-commercialization area that
the new center for excellence

might pursue, he said.

James E. Rooney, director of
Pantherlab Works, noted current
Pitt research to adapt technolo-
gies originally created for U.S.
Navy SEALS to develop noise-
blocking helmets. By transmit-
ting sound through  base,
the helmets would allow first
responders to hear instructions
over the noise of fires and crash-
ing buildings. ‘

Chancellor Mark A. Nor-
denberg mentioned, among
other Pitt research projects,
electrical engineering professor
Marlin Mickle’s work on using
radio frequency technology to
create a battery—free, constantly
recharging power source “that
could be extremely important
to ﬁrst responders.”

Murtha, a Pitt alumnusand
the ranking member of the U.S.
House’s Defense Appropriations
Subcommittee, said the new
center “is not just something for
Pittsburgh. This is not just some-
thing for western Pennsylvania.

This is for the nation, because we
need to take this technology that’s
being developed — and we’re
developing various technologies
right here at the University— and
get it out to the people and make
it cost-effective so they can afford
to buy it. «—

He added: “That’s what it’s
really all about. If we have it
on the shelf it doesn’t do us any
good.”

Rooney said the new center
will analyze first-respond-
ers’ needs, identify promising
research at Pitt and elsewhere,
and.   .¢9.I.I1PaI1ie.$..tl1?!t
can commercialize it. A H '

“We believe that many of the
needs that these ﬁrst responders
will require support the expan-
sion, creation and growth -of
industry clusters in which the
University of Pittsburgh and
other western Pennsylvania
research centers have already
established themselves as world
leaders,” said Rooney. ,

Once a viable project has
been identiﬁed, he said, the
center will leverage University
resources, (including the Office
of Technology Management, to
move these innovations from
laboratory to market.

“We believe the outcome of
this project will provide sub-
stantial beneﬁt to the needs of

our nation’s ﬁrst responders and
to all citizens in the event of a
disaster,” Rooney said. “We also
believe this national center will
expand western Pennsylvania’s

/ economy by capitalizing on our

research strengths to create new
business opportunities and, ulti-
mately, jobs.”

Rooney cited a recent report
by the Council on Foreign

Relations claiming that America »

is “dangerously unprepared” for
additional terror attacks. The
council’s report recommends

that the United States spend

, V up, to $98 billionyto prepare for

potential attacks.

Pitt officials and Murtha said
the new center should help to
bring some of those funds to
western Pennsylvania.

Chancellor Mark A. Norden-
berg said Pitt is “truly honored”
to be chosen as the ﬁrst campus
to house a Defense Department
center of excellence in ﬁrst-
responders teclmologies.

“While Pitt and the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Medical
Center are -established leaders
in bioterrorism preparedness,
the new center will harness tech-
nological innovation to help first
responders who risk their lives to
protect the public,” the chancel-
lor said.

I-Iqighest salaries jarring

To_ the editor:

Isn’t there something jarring,
even shameful in reading about
the huge salaries made by ‘phy-
sicians associated with the Uni-
versity (“No surprises on Pitt’s
list of highest-paid non—ofﬁcer
employees,”May27, 2004)? Isn’t
medicine a helping profession, a
dedication? Yet we see listed in
the UniversityTimes the salaries

of Pitt physicians in amounts of
over one million dollars through
the high hundreds of thousands
down to the lower multiples of a
hundred thousand.

In some way teaching and
research here seems reduced to
the mostly acquisitive, the Uni-
versity to a scheme for personal
enrichment, the medical profes-

sion to wealth over learning. It »

Belleﬁeld Hall and Trees
Hall recreation facilities available
to staff and faculty, under a plan
submitted recently to Chancellor
Mark A. Nordenberg.

The report came from a chan-
cellor-appointed committee that
studied staff and faculty exercise

ties.

Paraphrasing the report — a
copy of which sat open on the
meeting table in front of him
—Herbert Chesler, co-chair of
the University Senate beneﬁts
and welfare committee, told
Faculty Assembly June 1 that
the report’s recommendations, if
followed, would make the Belle-
field and Trees workout facilities
“moi'e welcoming to faculty and
staff, I believe.”

Chesler represented the
Senate benefits and welfare
committee on the chancellor-

_ appointed group. He refused to
quote the report’s actual wording.

miums, members of the Staff.

Association Council (SAC) and
the University Senate’s beneﬁts
and welfare committee agree.

It’s just too bad, they say,
that Pitt’s Human Resources
office and its medical insur-
ance consultants,didn’t consult
with SAC or the Senate before
announcing the new plan, which
will take effect July 1. ’

“Shared governance did
not playa part in the decision
to adopt. .the new plan,” SAC
President Rich Colwell told the
University Times.

’ “VVhether the plan would

have been changed in any way,
shape or form if we’d had input,
I have no idea. But_we would
have felt more conﬁdent about
it if we’d had input.” _

That said, Colwell called

the plan “a very good deal” for

Pitt and its retirees. “If we had
formed a committee and looked
into [medical insurance options
for retirees] we probably could
not have come up with anything
better than the plan that Human
Resources came up with,” he
said.

Herbert Chesler, co-chair of
the Senate committee, told Fac-
ulty Assembly on June _I that the
new plan represents “an accept-
able solution to a real problem
confronting the University.” Pitt
officials say the University will
pay about $6.2 million in retiree
and spouse medical premium
costs during the current ﬁscal
year, a 35 percent increase over
last year. That commitment is

expected to inc_rease in future
years with rising health care costs,
a growing retiree population and
longer life spans.
Announcement of the new
plan —- details of which were
first made public in the May
24 Pitt Chronicle 4 “resolves a
source of anxiety,” Chesler said.
“We’Ve been reading in the
newspapers for the last several
years that other employers have
been eliminating their medical
insurance programs for retirees.
The law has been interpreted in

such a way that employers were _

not obligated to provide medical
insurance for retirees.”

J After reading the Chronicle
story, Chesler said, "‘you would
have come away with the sense
that Pitt’s Board of Trustees was
exercising its ﬁduciary responsi-
bility and was indeed behaving
responsibly” in telling Human
Resources to scale back on the
University’s retirement medical
beneﬁts program.

“How nice it would have
been,” the Senate beneﬁts and
welfare co-chair added, “if the

board had instructed Human.

Resources to involve our com-

mittee” in its deliberations on

the new plan.
The new plan includes new

cost-sharing measures and a
service eligibility requirement
for new hires. '

Pitt staff and faculty who
already are retired will continue
to be covered by the current plan,
under which Pitt pays the full cost
of medical insurance for retirees
and their spouses older than 65.
For current retirees aged 62-65
and their spouses, the Univer-
sity covers 80 percent of those
costs.

Plan details are available from
Human Resources.

Staff and faculty approaching
retirement age will receive mail-
ings from Pitt about the plan.

to Faculty Assembly or give the
University Times a copy of the
report until Chancellor N orden-
berg has reviewed it.

Chesler’s Senate committee
has given up pushing for faculty
and staff access to the Petersen
Events Center’s Bill Baierl Stu-
dent Recreation Center. Nor~
denberg had steadfastly denied
that request, even before a 2003
student usage study found that
the student—only Baierl Center
was operating at full capacity.

Also at the June 1 Assembly
meeting, members rejected join-
ing a national coalition of faculty
senates advocating comprehen-
sive reform of NCAA Division
I-A athletics.

The Assembly voted 18-8
(with one abstention) to endorse
a resolution by the Senate athletic
committee, which argued against
Pitt’s Senate either joining the
Coalition On Intercollegiate
Athletics (COIA) or endorsing
the coalition’s framework for
reform. Assembly members also
voted to send the coalition a copy
of a Senate athletic committee
report criticizing some aspects
of COIA, together with a cover
letter from Senate President

J Nicholas G. Bircher.

Senate athletic committee
co-chairs Tony Eichelberger and
Williaing C.‘ Zarnboni said their
committee supported COIA’5
overall goal of promoting fac-
ulty involvement in running
intercollegiate athletics,.but they
questioned some of the coalition’s
motives and its refusal to consider
suggested amendments from new
member Senates to the group’s
framework.

The vote on the athletic
committee’s resolution had been
tabled ﬁom Faculty Assembly’s
May 4 meeting. See May 13

Deadline
looms for
anti sexual
harassment

on-line
training

itt staff, faculty and

students have until

July 31 to complete a
web-based course, “Preventing
Sexual Harassment,” aimed at
ensuring compliance with the
University’s policy against sexual
harassment. ‘

Completion of the course
is mandatory for all staff and
“highly recommended” for
faculty and students,” accord-

.ing to Pitt’s Office of Human

Resources. -

That distinction has irked
some staff employees, including
members of the staff councils
at the Pittsburgh, Bradford,
Greensburg and Johnstown
campuses, who met here May 6
at the annual Council of Cam-
puses gathering.

“VVhy is it ‘mandatory’ for
staff but only ‘recommended’
for faculty?” asked one annoyed

-Johnstown council member.

“Really, completing the
course is mandatory for faculty,
too,” said Provostjames V Maher

this week. “All faculty, staff and
students are strongly urged to
complete it.”

Pitt held mandatory meet-
ings for faculty several years ago
about sexual harassment, the
provost noted. “We’re hoping
that web-based courses like the
one currently being offered will
eliminate the need for more of
those meetings,” he said.

“There are no sanctions
against anyone who doesn’t
complete the course,” said Ron
Frisch, associate vice chancel-
lor for Human Resources, “but
we want to encourage people
strongly to take it. Everyone in
the organization, from the top
down, believes thisis important.

We’re encouraging the faculty as a

well as the staff, very much so,
to do this.” _
Offering the course should
not be misconstrued as indicat-
ing that sexual harassment is rife
at Pitt, Frisch added. “It’s just that
we want everyone to have as much
information and knowledge as

-will fail to reach addressees.

possible about this subject. '
This is a case where knowledge
is strength,” he said. .

SAC President Rich Colwell
said some staff who have yet to
complete the on-line course
told him they never received
the original memo (dated Oct.
7, 2 003) from Human Resources
informing employees about it.
The ﬁrst they heard about the
course, they said, was via an April
14 follow-up memo telling them
that Human Resources records
indicated they hadn’t taken it
yet, and that July 31 was the
deadline. After that date, Pitt’s
authorization to use the course
program will expire.

Frisch said it’s always possible
that some campus—mail memos

gadget has been connected to
the user’s Pitt portal home-
page, known as “My Page,”
users should:

° Go to the message center
site and click on “Junk Email Set-
tings” at the top of the window.
Clicking the On button below
the “Junk Email Blocking” head-
ing activates the spam ﬁlter.

0 Go to “Spam Filter” to select
the speciﬁc categories of junk e-
mail that they want to be blocked
by the ﬁlter. The categories are:

sexually explicit, get rich quick,
special offers and racially insensi-
tive or hate—oriented topics.

° Personalize their level
of protection against spam by
choosing one of ﬁve progressive
settings ranging from lenient to
aggressive within each category.
More aggressive settings will
catch more spam, but have a
greater potential to quarantine
legitimate e-mail as spam.

“People are going to be a
little bit nervous about using
the aggressive setting right
away, because they think they
might miss legitimate mail,”
Walton predicted. “But the thing
I’m happy about is that you still
have the chance to look at your
messages. I think people will

probably start in the ‘middle of

the road’ and gradually get more
aggressive as they become more
familiar with the service. But

the settings can be changed at -

any time.”

The key is to check the mes-
sage center periodically for quar-
antined messages, she said.

Users can further customize
their spam ﬁltering preferences
by using the “Approved Send-
ers” list and “Blocked Senders”
list functions, Walton said. Users
designate individual e-mail
addresses for their approved
senders list by manually enter-
ing the addresses. Mail sent
from these addresses automati-
cally bypasses the spam ﬁlter
and is delivered to the receiver’s
inbox. (Messages with suspected
viruses sent from approved send-
ers still will be ﬂagged by the virus
ﬁlter.)

If a user has given a pitt.edu
account address to a store because
he or she wants to hear about spe-

cial offers, for example, adding ,

the store’s e-mail address to the
approved senders list keeps that
address from being trapped as
spam.

Similarly, the blocked send-
ers list allows users to designate
e-mail addresses manually that
always will be quarantined by
the ﬁlter, regardless of content.
(This function has its limitations

because spammers often change
their e-mail addresses to avoid
being trapped by such lists.)

These lists are accessed from
the message center’s “Junk Email
Settings” link.

Walton said that Pitt signed a I

three-year contract with Postini,
which boasts over 3,300 compa-
nies as clients. “Postini claims to
trap 95 percent of spam,” she said.
“Using the aggressive setting, I
think it’s more like 99 percent or
higher for spam. For viruses, they
also say they trap 95 percent. So,
people still need to use anti-viral
software, as a precaution, to be
safe.”

Walton declined to _say how
much Pitt is paying Postini for
the spam and virus e-mail ﬁltering
service, citing a contract privacy
agreement.

, “We deliver about 13 million
e—mails a month, and we do start
to see things slow downas mail
increases,” she said. “I don’t want
to- have to keep investing money
to expand our capacity just so we
can deliver spam faster. So that’s
one of the advantages of using
Postini, because that spam is not
being stored on our system. It’s
really being stored by them.”

John Close, chair of the Senate

member of the Provost’s Coun-
cil on Academic Computing, said

those groups heartily endorsed

the new e-mail ﬁltering service.
“From everything we saw and
heard about thisservice, -where
users can customize their settings,
where there is user notiﬁcation
and where there is the two-week
period to ‘ﬁnd [any legitimate]

solution to» the spam problem.

And this ﬁts in with what I was ,

saying in the recent University

that individual users need to take

more responsibility for their own _

IUNE 10,2004

Committee focuses on pedestrian safety

ne of the charms of an
urban campus such as
Pitt’s is the plethora of

activities available within walking
distance. One of the drawbacks
is that walking around campus,
amid poorly marked pedestrian
crossings, unsafe road surfaces,
hazardous intersections, counter
trafﬁc—ﬂow bus lanes and some
75,000 cars whizzing through
Oakland on any given (lay, can
be dangerous.

Following two pedestrian
fatalities last fall, a University
Senate committee was galva-
nized to focus on pedestrian,
bicycle and trafﬁc safety on the
Pittsburgh campus.

The community relations
committee (CRC) appointed a
working group of Pitt faculty
and staff along with representa-
tives from community organiza-
tions and the City of Pittsburgh
to prepare recommendations on
campus pedestrian ‘safety that
Faculty Assembly and Senate
Council could consider adopt-
mg.
The rnission of the working
group is “to workwith University
decision-makers and community
partners to identify, advocate for
and monitor the implementation
of educational and enforcement
efforts to insure that the Oakland
campus is a pedestrian-friendly
and safe environment, recog-
nizing the rights and responsi-
bilities of both pedestrians and
drivers.”

Wesley Rohrer, co-chair

 Eit.t_,_,P_0liCe . Chief

 ‘Delaney of the CRC work-
ing group, presented initial
ﬁndings and recommendations
to the Assembly June 1 and the
Senatejune 7, while maintaining
that much more study needed to
be done.

“I want to stress that this is a
preliminary report of an evolv-
ing strategy,” Rohrer told the
Assembly last week. “One, it
doesn’t have the associated data
and references that you might
expect in a full report,” such as
data on local accidents, trafﬁc
tickets issued and pedestrian

.3» H -.

complaints. “That will come
later, in a more comprehensive
report by the end of the fall term,”
he said.

“This report is also prelimi-
nary in that it tries to highlight
some approaches that might be
considered to be put in motion
with regard to pedestrian and
trafﬁc safety. Thirdly, although
this is the work of a broad-based
working group, We actually want
to broaden that base and include
more representatives from the
community as well as other uni-
versities in the area.”

The committee will meet
regularly, expand its member-
ship, compile relevant data and
attempt to present formal recom-
mendations and an action plan to
Assembly and Council by the end
of the fall term, he added.

Rohrer strongly recom-
mended that the subcormnittee
or an equivalent group maintain
the focus on priorities, issues and
approaches for addressing pedes-
trian, bicycle and vehicular traffic
safety concerns. “The idea is that
we would continue to work with
the campus police, the Univer-
sity, the community and other
stakeholders, and look more
seriously at how to minimize
pedestrian accidents and increase
the awareness of pedestrians and
drivers in the area. The bottom
line is that our group or one
like it will continue to provide
the opportunity to fact—ﬁnd and
keep the institution informed on
this very important issue.”

Community relations com-
mittee (CRC) leaders this month
summarized the committee’s
efforts over the last year —- and
vowed to press on with such
efforts — to promote housing
opportunities forPittandUPMC
employees in near-to-campus
neighborhoods.

According to Tracy Soska,
outgoing chair of CRC, the
committee’s focus on area
housing, and particularly on
exploring employer—assisted
housing (EAH) options, grew
out of meetings with community

organizations with the common
goal of revitalizing the greater
Oakland area.

Such plans and “re—visions”
of Oakland and surrounding
neighborhoods as proposed by
a number of community groups
invariably focus on the impor-
tance of homeownership and
housing development, Soska said
at the June 1 Faculty Assembly
and June 7 Senate Council
meetings. . ‘

The community relations
committee has come “to better
appreciate the importance
of Oakland as more. than an
educational, medical and’ com-
mercial hub vital to the region’s
economy and future,” the com-

delay and walk-only features at
particularly dangerous intersec-
tions; enforcing traffic and jay-
walking violations, and sharing
resources among city, county,
University and community
organizations to increase public
awareness.

One of the byproducts of the
group’s deliberations, Rohrer

i

pointed out, was a pedestrian
safety poster display in the
Graduate School of Public
Health this spring, inspired by
the World Health Organization’s
2004 theme, “Road safety is no
accident.”

Rohrer also praised the work
of the Staff Association Counsel’s
safety and security committee in

documenting dangerous pedes-
trian areas on or near campus.

The CRC working group’s
report described the subcom-
mittee’s ﬁve main goals:

° Identify key issues and
problems, including high—risk
intersections and crossings, to
help prioritize safety efforts.

° Identify available resources
and partners including potential
funding sources, in—kind gifts,
volunteer services and products
relevant to trafﬁc safety.

° Develop a pedestrian safety
strategy with recommendations,
including approximating target
dates and costs for actions.

° Change the culture to
increase the level of safety aware-
ness on campus by integrating
safety with established programs
and processes such as student ori-
entation, and by adding programs
such as annual events focused on
pedestrian safety.

° Assess performance by
establishing a mechanism to
identify trends, accumulate data
and monitor the effect of recom-
mendations.

UNIVERSITY TIMES

lein aber fein (small

but ﬁne) is how Clark

uenzer describes Pitt’s

Department of Germanic Lan-

guages and Literatures, which
he chairs.

Muenzer’s colleagues in the
Association of Departments of
Foreign Languages (ADFL)
agree with his assessment. Based
on the results of an Andrew W.
Mellon Foundation—funded
survey of 2 ,63 1 foreign language
departments nationwide, ADFL
last fall selected Pitt’s German
department as a model of good
practice in the profession. It was
one of only two foreign language
units at Ph.D.-grantingU.S. uni-
versities to be so recognized.

The Pitt department’s seven
full-time faculty members (six
tenured/tenure track profes-
sors, including Muenzer, and
one non-tenure track lecturer)
were delighted by the national
recognition —— although they
showed no false modesty
about their success in boosting
enrolhnents and establishing a
multifaceted, student-friendly
program since the mid—l990s
under less—than—favorable con-
ditions: tight budgets, person-
nel reductions (the department
employed eight professors, all
tenured or in the tenure pipe-
line, when Muenzer began work
here in 1979), declining German
language enrollments nationally,
and the current foreign language
requirement in Pitt’s School of
Arts and Sciences, which is mini-
mal compared with those at most
peer universities. (Students who
come to Pitt having completed
three years of one language in

high .s9h99L.9!iEl1  gra£1§§..,at¢;...

exempt from further I
study.)

Also, German — unlike, say,
Slavic languages or Spanish —
these days attracts few U.S.-bom
“heritage learners” who want to
study it because the language is
spoken at home or by living family
members.

Nonetheless, the number of
Pitt students pursuing a B.A. in
German has roughly doubled
from 18 majors in 1995 to 30-40
in recent years (enrollments vary
from one term to another). For
students who want to continue
studying the language beyond
German 4, but don’t want
to take dozens of additional
credits in German studies, the
department in 1997-98 created
an 18-credit German language
certiﬁcate; some 20-25 students
are pursuing certiﬁcates in any
given term.

“We’re a small department,”
Muenzer points out, “but we
serve a very wide range of clien-
tele, from doctoral students to
beginning language students.”
In his chairperson’s message
on the department web site,
Muenzer writes, invitingly: “If
you want to study German ﬁlm,
or ﬁn-de-sierle Vienna, or ethnic
diversity in today’s German-
speaking countries, we probably
have something to offer you. If

children’s literature is of inter-
est to you, or Goethe or Kafka
or German—Jewish relations, or
the history of German cultural
politics in VV1lhemine Germany,
we have courses and curricular
options on which to build a pro-
gram of study.”

and part-time faculty to actually
teach languages (allowing senior
faculty to focus on their research
interests), Pitt’s German depart-
ment involves its whole faculty in
language instruction.
“Currently, ﬁve of our six
tenure lines are held by faculty
members pursuing research in lit-
erary criticism, ﬁlm and cultural
studies,” Pitt German professor
Sabine von Dirke noted in an
article proﬁling the department
in the fall 2003 ADFL Bulletin.

and a ecturer concentrate on lan-
guage pedagogy. Nevertheless, all
faculty members from assistant to
full professor regularly teach in
the language program.”

To encourage that, the depart-
ment seeks to align language
instruction with faculty research
interests. Von Dirke cited the
re-design of the depart1nent’s
second-year sequence during
the 1995-96 academicyear, which
took advantage of the faculty’s
strengths in such areas as ﬁlm
studies and multi-culturalism in
contemporary Germany. .

“The goal was to bring"

authentic cultural materials
into the second-year language
classroom that would reﬂect
the increasingly multi-cultural
character of Germany and help
students understand the histori-
cal forces that shaped the nation,”
von Dirke wrote. “At the same
time, the second-year language
sequence still needed to serve as
a review of the basic structures
of German grammar learned in
the ﬁrst year.

“Instead of using a second-
year language textbook, our
students now read an unedited,
illustrated children’s book,
‘Neben mir ist noch Platz,’ which

teaches about Germany’s difﬁcult
transformation into a multi-cul-
tural society by looking at the
friendship between Stephanie,
a German elementary school

‘girl, and Aischa, whose family

ﬂed the civil war in Lebanon.
In the next textbook, ‘Stimmen
eines Jahrhunderts,’ students
explore the topics of childhood
and social class, particularly with
regard to gender and social class,
by working with texts by Ernst
Toiler and Klaus Mann, with

George Grosz; theyalso ﬁewm

She also (noted that each
summer, amaverage of 5-6’ Pitt
German students participate in
a 12-credit exchange program
at the University of Augsburg in
southern Germany. To qualify,
the Pitt students must pass a
rigorous test of their German
ﬂuency because the program is
conducted in that language and
does not cater to Americans:
U.S. students attend classes at
Augsburg with native German
undergraduates and must write
papers in German. One of the
least expensive study-abroad pro-
grams available to Pitt students,
it costs about $4,000 including
ﬂight, room and board, and
spending money.

“There are many other,
excellent study-abroad programs
available to our students, but the

Augsburg program is the one that.

our department developed,”
Muenzer says. V

John B. Lyon, a recently hired
assistant professor in the depart-
ment, studied as an undergradu-
ate at a small liberal arts college
inMinnesota and did his graduate
work at Princeton. Pitt’s German
department features elements of

..,.l29.§l1....:._ hekga I

“By necessity, some 0 our
introductory courses have large
class sizes. But beyond that, I’ve
found that this department is
characterized by the small class
sizes and individual attention to
students that you would typically
ﬁnd at a small liberal arts school.
I ﬁnd that very striking at a uni-
versity the size of Pitt, with its
state-related status,” says Lyon.

The department also offers a
varietyofco—curricular activities,
often in cooperation with Pitt’s
student-run German Language
Club, that -give students‘oppor—
tunities to use their German
skills outside the classroom.
These include a career informa-

.tion panel with business profes-
sionals who majored in a foreign
language, an annual Kristallnacht
commemoration in cooperation
with Pitt’sJewish studies program
and an armual German essay con-
test. (Von Dirke noted: “Informal
polls among our students indicate
that students Whose achievement
in German was recognized in the
essay contest were highly likely
to continue with their language
studies and even pursue the cer-
tiﬁcate or major.”) \

Lisa Haegele, who graduated
in April with a double major in

 

German and French, attended the
annual ceremony during which
the German department honors
its essay contest winners. “The
whole atmosphere there was like
a little family. Everyone knows
each other well,” she says.

Before coming to Pitt, Hae-
gele had taken two years of high
school German but learned only
the present tense and had a very
limited German vocabulary. “I
even went to a few professors in
the German department when I
was a freshman here, saying ‘I’m
really weak in the language and
I’m scared.’ But theywere allvery
encouraging and supportive.”

Four years later, Haegele is
planning to begin her M.A. stud-
ies in the German department
next fall. Ultimately, she plans
to go on for a Ph.D. in German
(at another university, on the
advice of Pitt Gennan faculty
who urged her to broaden her
educational background) and
become a professor.

“I had — not expected that I
would be doing this at all,” she
says, witl1 a laugh. “I was actually
leaning towards French. But ulti-
mately, I became more proﬁcient
in German. I learned about the
culture much more.

“The French department is
great, but in the German depart-
ment there is a particular family
environment and I feel very com-
fortable there. I feel like I can
contribute a lot towards it and still
be happy with my work.”

According to Justin Leiby,
a Pitt senior who is pursuing
degrees in German and busi-
ness, the commitment to teaching
and mentoring “is much higher



it is among many other Pitt
departments whose courses I’ve
taken. Every faculty member in
the department seems to be an
educator ﬁrst and a researcher or

academic trying to further his or

I her career second. I have yet to

ﬁnd a single faculty member
in the department who doesn’t
practically beg you to visit them
in their ofﬁce.”

At the same time, department
faculty keep in mind that nearly
all of the undergrads they teach
are headed for careersinbusiness,
law, medicine — something other
than German studies. “Only
a minute percentage of our
undergraduate majors will go
on to get advanced degrees in
German literature and culture,”
Muenzer observes. “We avoid
the mistake, common among
language departments, of seeing
them as miniature German pro-
fessors.”

Because of its small size, Pitt’s
German department chose to
focus on what it calls modern
Germany and German culture
—— from the 18th century to
the present. The curriculum,
especially in advanced language
courses, emphasizes the 20th
and 21st centuries and contem-
porary, multi-ethnic Germany,
a perspective also provided to
students by the department’s
seven or eight (the number varies
from term to term) German- and
Eastern European-bom teaching
assistants and fellows.

Muenzer says: “People who
have an oom-pa-pa image of Ger-
many wouldn’t know Where they
were if they got on a subway in
Munich today, which would likely
be full of Vietnamese and Turks

2005.

The 35,200 sq. ft. facility will include 24 apartments with 109
beds. Each apartment will have two full bathrooms. a living
room and a kitchenette. The three-story residence hall will
include a central common space for television lounge, lobby,

the top three problems respon-
dents encountered upon ﬁrst

 movingto Pittsburgh, according

to the survey.

More than half the survey’s .

39 respondents said they were
not familiar with employer-
assisted housing programs,
Hartman said, which can pro-
vide mortgage money and other
employer-assisted services in
support of affordable housing.
Depending on what parties agree
to, EAH services can include
home—buyer workshops; help

in locating affordable housing;
ﬁnancial and credit counseling;
closing costs assistance; down
payment assistance; matching
savings; “rent to buy” options,
and loan guarantees.

Hartman acknowledged that
the survey response was disap-
pointing, a result of limited
promotion.

Soska told the University
Times that the survey was
designed as a marketing tool
rather than a scientiﬁc study.

stability and lessening problems
of absentee landlords and hous-

The community relations
committee is not yet pushing
for EAH programs to become
an employee benefit, Soska
said. Rather, the committee
will continue gathering data
on housing opportunities and

responsible for making recom-
mendations, he said. a

, Seavoyagewill be the ﬁrst
aboard the Explorer.

The ship was launched in 2002

as the Olympia Explorer by Royal

Olympic Cruises, which went out

of business in March. The ship

will replace the S.S. Universe

Explorer, SAS’s primary “ﬂoat-
ing campus” since 1996.

The Explorer is bigger, faster,

newer and better-equipped than

the Universe Explorer, which ‘

went into service in 195 3 as the
last American—built passenger
steamship. The Explorer can

house up to 685 students, 40 more

than the Universe Explorer.

At 24,300 tons and 590 feet
in length, the new ship has about
one-third more space for class-
rooms, labs, the library and other
campus facilities than the Uni-
verse Explorer. Built by Blohm &
Voss in Germany, the Explorer is
billed as the fastest passenger ship

in the world, with a peak cruising
speed of 30 knots.

“The new ship operates with
good fuel efficiency at 22-23
knots, compared with the Uni-
verse Explorer’s fuel-efﬁcient
cruising speed of 16-17 knots,”
said Julian Asenjo, associate
director for enrolhnent man-
agement of the Institute for
Shipboard Education, which
administers SAS out of ofﬁces in
the William Pitt Union. Accord-

ing to Asenjo, greater speed will
enable SAS to reach a geographi-
cally wider range of ports during
a single voyage. -

“The fact that this ship is only
two years old is another great
advantage,” he added. “Traveling
26,000 miles at a pop [during an
around-the-world voyage] really
takes its toll on.an older ship.”

SAS has been academically
sponsored by Pitt since 1981..

RESEARCH NOTES

Studies may
enhance
understanding
of sports
injuries,
performance

Studies conducted at Pitt’s
Neuromuscular Research Lab-
oratory (NMRL) may provide
better understanding of the
prevention and treatment of
certain sports—related injuries
and athletic performance.

Pitt researchers presented
ﬁndings of several studies last
week at the American College
of Sports Medicine 51st annual
meeting in Indianapolis.

The following are summaries
of three NMRL presentations.

Throwing athletes’ shoulders
differ from non-throwers’

Pitt research showing that
throwing athletes have certain
differences in shoulder blade
position and orientation com-
pared to non-throwing athletes
may help doctors better under-
stand and manage shoulder inju-
ries in throwing athletes.

VVhile examining injuries
associated with the throwing
motion in throwing athletes,
athletic trainers and doctors rou-
tinely evaluate the position, ori-
entation and three-dimensional
movement of the shoulder blade,
or scapula. The scapula acts as the
stable base of support between the
arm and trunkwhile still allowing
for the high degree of movement
needed from the upper extrem-
ity during the throwing motion.
However, minimal research has
been done to quantify scapular
position and orientation in
throwing athletes compared to
non-throwing athletes.

A study at Pitt’s NMRL has
shown that experienced throwing
athletes do indeed have certain
scapular position and orienta-
tion differences compared to
non—throwers, suggesting that
throwers develop chronic adap-
tation for more efﬁcient perfor-
mance of the throwing motion.

The ﬁndings may provide
clinicians with a better under-
standing of types of adaptations
that may be observed in normal,
healthy throwing athletes and
thus potentially lead to more
effective injury prevention and
treatment.

A two—year grant from NFL
Charities provided support for
the study, which enrolled 21
healthy, uninjured throwing
male athletes to compare with
a control group of 21 healthy,
uninjured male non-throwers.

All study subjects performed spe-
ciﬁc related motion tasks while
sophisticated biomechanical
and neuromuscular assessment
tools monitored certain scapu-
lar positioning, orientation and
movement during the assigned

tasks.

Stronger hip muscles =
better golf

Golfers with stronger hip
muscles reported having better
golf performances compared to
golfers who showed weaker hip
muscles in an NMRL study.

To determine if there is any
difference in hip strength among
golfers with different proﬁciency
levels, the relationship between
hip strength and golf handicap,
and between hip strength and
self—reported driving distance,
researchers divided 82 golfers
into three groups based on their
proﬁciency levels . according to
self—reported driving distance
and handicap. Using laboratory
neuromuscular strength assess-
ment tools, researchers studied
each participant’s isometric hip
abduction and adduction strength
in side-lying with the hip joint in
neutral position for both legs.

Left hip abduction strength
was signiﬁcantly higher in the
better golfers’ groups; in the
best golfers’ group, all hip move-
ments tended to be stronger. The
results of this study demonstrate
the importance of hip musc11la—
ture for stability of the tr11nk and
the balancing forces transferred
between lower body and upper
body extremities during the golf
swing. This. may be related :.to
overall golf performance.

Unplanned reactive
jumps should be included
in ACL research

Injuries to the ACL (anterior
cruciate ligament), the main sta-
bilizing ligament in the knee, are
common among athletes, and up
to eight times more common in
female athletes. Research into
the risk factors of non—contact
ACL injury prevention often
calls for study participants to
perform planned vertical stop-
jump tasks.

However, NMRL investiga-
tors say that ACL injury preven-
tion research protocols should
include unplanned reactive
jumping tasks to better simulate
actual athletic competition.

In the Pitt study, 26 male
and female basketball players
performed both pre-planned
stop-jump tasks and unplarmed
stop-jump tasks upon reaction

to sudden visual cues during the
jump, which represents more
actual athletic competition.
During the reactionary jumps,
the players demonstrated a
decreased knee ﬂexion angle
with a greater deceleration
component compared to when
they performed pre-planned
stop-jump tasks.

The ﬁndings suggest that
reactive jumping tasks should
be included when researchers
are trying to determine the
at—risk movement patterns for
non-contact ACL injuries.

A grant from the Jewish
Healthcare Foundation provided
support for the study.

Researchers at Pitt and The

HK97 has properties similar to
some animal viruses, including
herpesviruses. The researchers’
ﬁndings were reported in the]une

properties. Typically, as bacte-
riophages mature, the DNA-
containing capsid is strengthened
by many weak contacts between
capsid proteins or by extra pro-
teins that act as glue.

In HK97, however, the mature
capsid is stable because the pro-
teins form chemical bonds, or
cross-links, with each other as
the capsid expands. HK97 was
the ﬁrst bacteriophage discov-
ered to form these stabilizing
cross-links.

Researchers now know that
HK97 begins to form cross-
links early in the maturation
process, at the same time that
the capsid expands in size and
DNA is pumped inside. It was
previously thought that the
cross-links were the last step in
the process. This research may
help elucidate how and why pro-
teins change their shape, interact
with other proteins, and assemble

“Once we understandindetail
how viruses get assembled from

UPCI , _

resent
indings .

Researchers from the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Cancer
Institute presented ﬁndings from
several studies at the armual meet-
ing of the American Society of
Clinical Oncology, June 5-8 in
New Orleans.

Highlights included the fol-

lowing:

Vaccine elicits immune
response in metastatic
melanoma patients

Results from the largest multi-
site study to date evaluating a pep-
tide-derived therapeutic vaccine
for melanoma show promising
evidence that researchers can
activate a patient’s own immune
system to ﬁght advanced cases of
the deadly skin cancer.

“This is the ﬁrst time we
have evaluated peptide-derived
melanoma vaccine results from
a multi-center cooperative
group trial,” said John Kirk-
wood, principal investigator of
the study, professor of medicine
at Pitt and director of UPCI’s
Melanoma Center;

“We have found evidence
that the vaccine stimulates an
immune response and that it is
reasonable to evaluate the cor-
relation between “disease course
and immune response forpatients
who receive the vaccine.”

The phase II study, funded by
the National Institutes of Health
and the Schering Plough and

Imrnunex Corporations, involved

120 patients with metastatic V

melanoma and researchers from
30 research institutions across
the country.

. Malignant melanoma is one
of the deadliest forms of skin
cancer. This year there will be
an estimated 54,200 new cases
as well as 7,600 deaths from the
disease.

Pancreatic cancer vaccine
found ‘to be safe, also stimulates
immune activity

Results from a phase I study to
evaluate the toxicity of a potential
therapeutic vaccine for pancreatic
cancer demonstrate that patients
can safely tolerate multiple doses
of the vaccine.

Preliminary evidence indi-
cates that the vaccine, a synthetic
version of a molecule expressed
on pancreatic tumor cells, in
combination with a patient’s own
antigen—presenting cells (known
as dendritic cells), boosts immune
activity in pancreatic cancer
patients.

Only half of the delivered dose
of a commonly used chemothera-
peutic agent may be activated in
cancer patients, according to a
study that analyzed data from 3 1
cancer patients given 30-minute
infusions of gemcitabine.

The study found that while
approximately 50 percent of the
gemcitabine dose was likely to be
converted to active metabolites,
the other 5 0 percent was likely to
be inactivated and, as a result, pos-
sibly did not contribute to a thera-
peutic effect. I

But according to Leiby, he
and other students who study

‘German at Pitt would prefer

an even greater emphasis on
today’s Germany. “There is a
heavy emphasis on‘ Goethe and
German classicism of 200 ‘years
ago, which is all well and good,”
he says. “But I believe that if the
department focused more on
contemporary and 20th-century

aspects of German culture, it
would be more invigorating for
the students while catering more
to the faculty’s own specialties. I
mean, someone like Sabine Von
Dirke is renowned for her study of
post—modernist topics. It’s almost
foolish to not make greater use
of her expertise.”

Muenzer responds: “We
absolutely strive to offer our
students a balanced curriculum.
That curriculum reﬂects the

pt. recognized

‘different research specialties of
our tenured and tenure—stream
faculty,” of whom only two
specialize in pre—1900 German
culture and literature.

Department faculty take turns
teachingupper-levelundergradu-
ate seminars, so it’s likely a matter
of chance if a student winds up
taking more than a single seminar
dealing with pre—1900 Germany,
says Muenzer. 3

“Not that I want to discount

the importance of studying
l8th- and 19th-century Germany
either,” he adds. For example, any
student who wants to understand
ethnic diversity in ‘contempo-
rary Germany would do well
to study what the philosopher
Johann Gottfried Von Herder
(1744-1803) wrote about multi-
culturalism, the department
chair says. _

people,” says Muenzer, “good
things happen to them.” As a

that the hard way. For example,

PEOPLE OF THE "I'IIVIES

Sunil Saxena, assistant
professor in the Department of
Chemistry, recently received the
Faculty Early Career Develop-
ment Award, the National Sci-
ence Foundation’s (NSF) most
prestigious honor for new faculty
members. The award recognizes
teacher—scho1ars most likely to

become academic leaders in the A

21st century.

Saxena was recognized for
developing technology called,
pulsed electron spin resonance,
a phenomenon that occurs when
certain molecules are placed, in
a static magnetic ﬁeld. VVhen
exposed to speciﬁcally designed
bursts of oscillating magnetic
ﬁelds, the molecules emit signals

that indicate how the molecules

move. Using the technology,
Saxena examines how biological
molecules organize and rearrange
over time.

The NSF award will support

development of new experimen-

tal designs and procedures to .

emitted signals. The information
in the signals will help explain
how such proteins as the glycine
receptor change and interact in
their native environment. The
glycine receptor, which helps
mediate signals to and from
the brain, has been resistant "to
conventional methods of study.
Many diseases, including epilepsy
and other seizure disorders, are
associated with the glycine
receptor. '

“This research will lead to new
technology that will enhance our
ability to systematicallyimeasure
and understand the fundamental

‘ processes that control cellular

functions,” said Saxena, who
is collaborating with Michael
Cascio, assistant professor in
the Pitt medical school’s Depart-

ment of Molecular Genetics and ,

Biochemistry.

Saxena earned a Ph.D. in
chemistry at Cornell University
and completed his postdoctoral
training at California Institute of
