Steel tariffs removed, union criticizes

CHRISTIAN NIEDAN
V Staff Writer

VV1th economic pressure mounting from I

foreign interests, the Bush administration
has repealed tariffs on foreign steel 16_
months before they were supposed to end,
dealing another blow to Western
PennsylVania’s already hurting steel indus-

' The World Trade Organization, which  
was prepared to ratify a decision by their _
high court‘ declaring such tariffs illegal, ’

granted a U.S.-requested delay on its ﬁnal
decision two weeks ago. '

The European Union, a key U.S. trade ‘

partner, had already declared that it was
ready to impose about $2.2 billion worth of

' sanctions on imported American goods
- a week of a decision from the WTO

high coL1rt, if the U.S. did not relent, Japan

and Norway had also announced similar
planned sanctions.

— . With the Bush administratiOn’s decision
last Thursday to do away with the tariffs, the
EU retracted its threat of sanctions, which
EU Trade Commissioner Pascal Larny
describedas a “tool for compliance,” accord-
ing to CNN.

A The repeal was met by strong criticism
from the nation’s largest Steelworkers’ union,
which declared that repealing the tariﬁs pro-
vided I “clear evidence of capitulating to
European blackmail, and a sony betrayal of
American steelworkers and steel communi-
ties.” “ . " _
Since the evolution of railroads in the
middle of the 19th century, steel has been
one of America’s symbols of industrial
strength. Over the decades, however, tech-
nological advances and globalization have
opened up the market to worldwide compe-

tition and resulted in the economic downturn
of the industry —- and the loss of many
workers’ jobs.

United Steelworkers of America
President Leo W. Gerard denounced the
repeal as being politically motivated.

“In his rush to appease the Europeans
and Japanese, Mr. Bush willfully ignored the
fact that damage to the American steel indus-
try and American steel communities contin-
ues to this day, even with the tariffs in place,”
Gerard said _

Frank Giarratani is ﬂre director of Pitt’s
Center for Industry Studies, which is an
industry research group housed in the
Department of Economics. According to
Gianatani, steel taritfs were meant to help
U.S. steel manufacturers compete in the
global market.

SGB’s SWAPitt

may let students
swap, auction

KATIE LEONARD
Assistant News Editor

At the end of every semester, there are
students who can’t quite comprehend how
a book they bought four months earlier for
$100 could depreciate to less than half its
value.

When these students go to sell back
their books to the bookstore, they often take
whatever money they’re offered —— even if
they think they should be entitled to more.

VVrth the Student Government Board’s
help, students will have an alternative to
selling back their books to‘ a bookstore —
tlreywill soon be able to SWAPitt

The new online program, SWAPitt,
will act as an e-Bay-type system on which
Pitt students can sell their used books.’ But
unlike many other schools throughout the
country that allow students to sell their
books, Pitt’s site will allow students to auc-
tion their items.

Other schools that outgoing SGB
member Stephanie Hadgkiss researched
had sites with classiﬁed listings for students
to sell their books and oﬂrer possessions,
but they did not include an auction feature.

“I hope we’re going to be the buzz,”
she said of the new auction feature.

Bob Winners, who worked on the
technical side of the site’s development
throughout the semester, said the auction
feature was not more difficult than a classi-
ﬁed system to develop — it just requires
more time to work on it. He added that this
feature should make SWAPitt unique, even
among other Pitt book-swapping programs.

During the summer, when the mem-
bers and president of SGB went on their
armual retreat, they discussed the idea of
buying a server for the board. At the time,
Hadgkiss knew nothing about servers.

Board member Scott Morley informed
her that a server could act as a storage place
for programs, such as professor proﬁles and
a book swap.

Information boom keeps

pace with new technology  

CHRISTIAN NIEDAN
Staff Writer’

People around the globe created
enough new information in 200.2 to
fill the U.S. Libraries of Congress
500,000 times. .

Considering the Population
Reference Bureau’s world popula-
tion estimate of 6.3 billion people,
that works out to the equivalent of a
30-foot tall pile of books per per—‘
son. 2

The information was released in
a recently published study conduct-
ed by faculty and students from the
School of Information Management
and Systems at the University of
California-Berkeley. The Berkeley
study received financing from digi-

tal information dealers like Intel‘

Corp., Microsoft
Hewlett-Packard Co. _
When compared with the results

Corp. and

- of a 2000 study by the same group,

which used data from .1999, stored
information created during the past
three years has increased by 30 per-
cent. .
The United States is the biggest
producer of data, creating, since
1999, about 40 percent of the
world’s new stored information, 33
percent of its new printed data and
30 percent of its new films, accord-
ing to the study. V

The evolution of technologies
to capture, transmit, and store
information, however, has grown
just as rapidly.

The 2003 study classified new
information into four main forms:
print, film, magnetic and optical.
Theseforms of information ﬂow
through four common tr_ansmitters:

telephone, television, Internet and

radio.

But aside from potentially fill-
ing many libraries, the changing
ways of creating and "transmitting
information have affected almost
everyone in the communication
industry, as well as the general pub-
lic. ,

Pitt’s student—run radio station,
WPTS 92.3, has been changing the
way it brings music and program-
ming to its listeners. Station promo-
tions, identification spots and inter-
views that went out over the air
usedto be recorded in a recording
booth. They were then transferred
to analogue carts, which are similar
to cassettes, and plugged into
machines for airplay. .

Recently, the station switched
to a digital format. Instead of carts,

'1.‘ 9'§.~f!I?'-71$‘-I JO?

which take up physical recording
space and ‘are difficult to edit,
recorded messages now go from the
recording booth to a server on a
computer, where they can be stored
and edited, and then sent directly to
a digital delay machine for-airplay.

“Digital is faster, cheaper and
more versatile,” said station-general
manager Tim Rensland, who added
that the station’s server capacity

0‘ will soon be doubled from 40 giga-
bytes to 80 to keep up with space
demands.

WPTS is also preparing, to re-
launch radio Web casting, in which
people can access a Web site and
listen to streaming radio station
programming from their computers,

.after a 2-year hiatus caused by legal
issues. Legal challenges have
impeded the growth, of online radio
stations, including Pitt’s own.
Study’ researchers once thought
such stations were poised for mas-
sive expansion in 2000.

“Web casting lets us reach a
much wider audience of people in a

' non-traditional way,” said WPTS

Assistant Chief Engineer Rob Hart.
“That attracts underwriters for our
programming by actually showing
them all the listeners we’re get-
ting.”

Photography is another area in
which digital technology has

evolved and gained popularity,.

according to study researchers. The
study found that digital cameras are
rapidly gaining dominance over
film-based photography worldwide.

Digital camera prints can be saved,

and printed on a PC, so digital cam-
era users don’t have to worry about
wasting‘ rolls of film and money
printing poor photographs.

A_nthony Acernese, a senior
neuroscience major at Pitt, said he
decided to spend about $350 on a
4.1-megapixel camera with a 1,000-
photo storage capacity, rather than
buy a cheaper film camera.

“I was tiredvof the hassle of

having to go down, pick up and pay ‘ ’

for film,” Acernese said. “I didn’t

want to waste money on bad pic-

tures.”

The use of digital video, DV, for
recording moving images has also
risen in popularity during recent
years, according to the study.

Pitt’s student—run television sta-
tion, UPTV, has always filmed all
programming using DV format,
according to station director Sam

Celebration brings dance, music

LAURA J ERPI
Staff Writer

The spirit of the season ﬁlled the air
Sunday at the Nationality Rooms
Program’s Holiday Open, House, held
in the Cathedral of Learning. Hundreds

‘ of people came to take part in the event,

which lasted from noon until 4 p.m.
Multi—cultural clubs throughout the
Pittsburgh area, including the South
Hills Junior Tamburitzans of South
Hills, the Filipino American
Association of Pittsburgh and the Nego
Gato Children’s Ensemble, performed
songs and dances in 15-minute install-
ments in the Commons Room.

Chantel Snyder, a Pitt work-
study employee working at the
event, said the nationality room
committees were not required to
have displays —— only those
choosing to participate took part
in the event. This was Snyder’s
second year working at the event,
and she said the event was also
very crowded last year.

The majority of the groups
were present. They held displays
in the Commons Room selling
food, crafts and various products
native to their countries and cul-
tures.

Many groups, ‘including the
Czechoslovak Committee and the
Chinese Committee, showed their
holiday spirit by having a wide
variety of seasonal ornaments for
sale.

One group, the Swiss
Nationality Room Committee,
held a display to assist in raising
money to construct the already
approved, but not yet built, Swiss

Nationality Room.

Each of the 26 Nationality Rooms
was festively decorated for the holi-
days. They were all open for the guests
to come and go as they pleased. A rep-
resentative, dressed in an appropriate
native costume, stood in each room to
answer any questions visitors might
have.

The Nationality Rooms have been
decorated for the holidays since mid-
November, and they will remain deco-
rated until mid—January. They will be
open for tours during the holidays. For
more information on Nationality Room

‘tours, call (412) 624-6000.

Tariffs could be election issue 0
for some steel-producing states

Steel, page 1

“The U.S. steel industry was very frag-
mented compared to, say, the European steel
industry,” he said. “In Europe, there are a
small number _of large ﬁrms, while in the
U.S., there are a large number of small

Tariifs of as much as 30 percent were
imposed on foreign-made steel imports in
March 2000. The tariffs were meant to stay

for a three-year period, giving the ﬂagging —

American steel industry time to consolidate
and compete with inexpensive foreign steel
makers, according to the Bush
Administration.

The USW, a union representing rough-
' ly 1.2 million working and retired steel-

workers in ﬂie United States and Canada, is
based in Pittsburgh. USW spokesman John
Duray said the repeal of tariffs sends a bad
message to workers.

“Bush has no problem standing up to
Europe when it comes to going to war in
Iraq, but he doesn’t seem to have any back-
bone when it comes to protecting American
steelworkers,” Duray said.

Some people had speculated that prod-
ucts made from steel would become more
expensive as a result of the tariffs, but Duray

“All these ‘doom and gloom’ accusa-
tions by steel importers against tariffs have
no substance to them,” Duray said. “There
were people who said there would be steel
shortages, which never happened, and that
tariffs would break steel-consurning indus-
tries, which it hasn’t.” .

Giarratani says the tariffs helped create
a necessary strategy for ﬂie competitive sur-
vival of the U.S. steel industry.

“The industry has been through major

restructuring in the last 18 months, which
has been necessary progress for it to stay
competitive,” he said. “If steel tariffs are
repealed, that’s not going to slow that
progress, though it may hurt the proﬁts of the
large steel ﬁrms.”

The result of all this is a contentious
economic issue that President Bush
remained notably quiet about during his
fundraising visit to the city last week

The goods chosen by the EU for possi-
ble sanctions come from key electoral states
like Florida, North and South Carolina, and
Pennsylvania. Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa,
responded to the choice of goods in a press

"release last week ' I ’

“What the international community is
doing is playing politics with how theyfre
retaliating by picking industries in states that
are important to this president,” he said.
“That just tells you how political this whole
dynamic is from the international communi-
ty’s perspective, and why we believe we
need to stand up and’ do what’s right on
behalf of the steel industry.”

VV1th the presidential election less than
11 months away, the decision to repeal the
tariffs is seen by some political pundits as a
possible issue for key steel-producing states

‘ like Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia.

6 “’Ihe decision by the Bush adrninistra-
tion to impose tariffs was, in my opinion, a
political one, rather than an economic one,”

- said  “So the decision to repeal
them will probably be a political decision,
rather than an economic one.”

Steel-consurning, metal-fabricating
industries like automobile, appliance and
construction, which have strong voting con-
stituencies of their own, stand to gain the
most from the repeal of tariffs and cheaper
steel prices, he said.

SWAPitt, page 1

When Hadgkiss heard about the poten-
tial for a book swap, she was immediately
interested. Initially, she called it Pitt Swap,
which prompted another board member to
think of SWAPitt.

“I’ve never been good with the nam-
ing,” Hadgkiss said.

She said she was drawn to this project

because it had the potential to be a long- 0

standing program at Pitt, adding that she
thinks those are the types of programs SGB
should focus on. Other long—lasting pro-
grams that SGB started in the past include
Arrival Survival, Telefact and Van Call.

This — like other longstanding pro-
jects —- is not something from which the
board is looking to make a proﬁt. The site
will simply provide a place for students to
log on for free to sell or buy books. V

When listing a new book for auction,
the seller can put in, not only the author’s
name and title, but also the book’s ISBN
number. An ISBN number serves as an
identiﬁcation code, so that students buying
books will know the texts are the -exact
copies of the books required for their class-
es.

After listing a book for sale, the seller
can put in a base—selling price for it. This

will allow the seller to make sure she gets at _

least the amount of money the bookstores

would give her if she sold it back to them.
The site will suggest that students sell-

ing books request a cash payment from the

. buyer. Credit cards will not be accepted,

Hadgkiss said. The site will not act as a third
party in the billing process; rather, once an
individual wins an auction, he and the sell-
er will be sent e—mails, The students will
have to contact one another to set up a meet-
ing place to exchange the money and the

__ books. 4

“Other schools have found these sites
very successful,” she said.

On the University of Toronto’s site,

there are about 15,000 books listed. At Ohio,

University, there are usually between 700 .

and 800 books listed, she added.
Knowing nothing about computer pro-

gramming, Hadgkiss" had to ﬁnd someone ‘

who could help‘ develop SWAPitt. During

Arrival Survival, a mutual ﬁiend introduced »

her to Winners, a senior computer science
major. He had set up a similar program for
one of his classes, so he already had ‘the
basic codes to set up the site.

“I’m just getting a kick out of it,” he
said. “It’s something that students will be
using, and I worked on it.” ,

While employed by Pitt’s Computing
Services and Systems Development during
the summer, Winners worked on program-
ming. He currently works for ResNet, the
on-site computer help program for students
living on campus.

Before the site oﬁicially opens, the
University’s lawyers need to look at"it to
make sure that it complies , with law.
Hadgkiss said she hopes that, after the book
swapping succeeds, the site will let students

auction off furniture and other possessions.
The board also needs to decide where the
site is going to exist — whether it will be
put on an outside company’s dot—com, on a
new, SGB—owned server or on an existing
Pitt Web site. They are currently waiting to
hear ﬁom Student Life for advice on what
to do. .

The board is also looking for beta
testers, students who will tryout the site
before it is opened for general use, to see
how it works and to provide suggestions on
how to make it better. According to
Hadgkiss, she’d like at least 100 students to
be. involved in the testing. Those involved

. will not only get a sneak peak at the site, but

a free, “snazzy” T—shirt as well.

The site has safeguards to prevent stu-
dents from bidding just one cent more than
competitors, or from bidding extraordinary
amounts of money. There will be a mini-
mum increase requirement of two percent
and a maximum of 75 percent The maxi-
mum cap is necessary so that no one can bid

an unrealistic amount of money, such as a‘

million dollars, and prevent students who
actually want to buy the book from bidding,
Hadgkiss said. ' ,

Hadgkiss hopes that, in the future, the
site will be capable of automatically bidding
for students until the auction reaches a set
maximum.

Though her term is nearing its ﬁnal
days and the site is not up for student use

, SGB looking for studentsto test, comment on new online, book trading site

quite yet, Hadgkiss said that she will stick
around to make sure it is completed and will

work with the new board to get it ﬁnished. v

Joe Pasqualichio, who was recently
elected to the Board, ran part of his platform
on the development of SWAPitL

“I think it just shows the broad appeal
of the program,” Hadgkiss said, adding that
its appeal will make the program more suc-
cessful through the transition of boards.

Hadgkiss laughed when she talked
about an article from The Pitt News’ April
Fools edition several years ago. The article,
about the things that SGB takes credit for,
included online trading, she said.

Now, she said, it is something that the
Board is actually bringing to Pitt.

Cotler. The station launched two
years ago as Creation Station.

‘The financial constraints of-
_DV‘ are relatively inexpensive,
compared to what network TV
uses,” Cotler said. “Some shows on
TV, like news programming, use the
same thing.” .

After filming, footage is trans-
ferred to computer hard drives. and
edited therewith programs like

, Final Cut Pro. Footage is then sent

to another computer, where it is
changed to an MP2 format. Once
converted, thefootage is sent to a

0 remote server in a campus building,
.where the program is transmitted to

campus cable. .
DV tapes record data in the
computer language of ones and

zeros, rather than the analog tech-.'

nique of audio and video. UPTV
stores past programming on such
tapes, but the staff is considering a
switch to DVD disks or higher qual-
ity DV tape that won’t wear out
after repeated use. _ _

Although amateur use of DV
has become more common recently,
the study found that the movement
toward DV in commercial
moviemaking has been slower than
with photography, because many

movies made for mass consumption
were found to have a “quf1..1ity’.

EDITORIAL ,
Swearing Kerry should keep talking

Democratic presidential hopeful
John Kerry used some mighty salty
language in the most recent edition
of Rolling Stone.

In reference to George W. Bush’s
handling of the war in Iraq, Kerry
said, “When I voted for the war, I
voted for what I thought was best for
the country. Did I expect George
Bush to f——- it up as badly as he did?
I don’t think anybody did.” .

Strong words from one who
hopes to lead the country. While it is
refreshing to hear someone in the
spotlight make such a blunt state-
ment of what so many are thinking, it
was a risky move.

Kerry’s candidacy is on the line.
He will be held to a higher level of
scrutiny now that he is “the swearing
politico.” His words will certainly
come back to haunt him, possibly
marking him as a firebrand, and pos-
sibly leading to the expectation that
he will always speak so plainly.

He has perhaps done a disservice
to the Democrats, and perhaps has
»done the opposite. His words are the
first real sign of life from a party that
is perceived to be-mired down with
too many candidates and lacking the
spine to be decisive. So, while it’s
encouraging to see such spunk,—it’s
too bad Kerry had to resort to locker-
room language to show it.

Regardless of the'effect_.of such a
statement, one thing is certain. Kerry

has called attention to himself, and to
his views. The right thing to do, now,
would be for him to back up his
expletive with some substance. If he
thinks Bush is mishandling the con-
ﬂict, now is the time for him to tell

8 thecountry what‘ he would have done

differently, or_ how he will clean
things up if he is elected president.

The White House is calling for_

Kerry to_apologize for his remarks.
He’s got their attention; he’s rattled
them. He should capitalize on his
moment of being thrust into the spot-
light. ’

He has ripped open the range of
tolerable politicaldiscourse on the
administration’s handling of the war.‘
Now he must dive in headfirst.

It’s truly heartening that some-
one with so much to lose is willing to
speak so boldly. What would be
encouraging would be to see Kerry
use his un-presidential lead—in to say
something truly presidential. Many
people are unhappy~with the way the
war is going. So far, no one has
given any decent suggestions. Kerry
could be the man to, do it. '

One thing is certain. No matter
how much the White House cries and
huffs and puffs, John Kerry should
not retract his statement, or apolo-

gize for it, or try to mitigate it in any
. way; . V ‘

He said it; he meant it. Now he
should stand by it and back it up.

I have been with my boyfriend? for

almost two and a half years, and I am notic— '

ing that he is not as.excited about sex as he
used to be. I am still all about giving and get-

Dear Missing:  .

Is the lad in question aware
of your preferences? The best
way to get him to go below the
border more is to simply let him .
know you love it and are rniss—
ing it. The direct route, while
lacking in intrigue, is the most
reliable way to communicate
your desires.

If you can’t stand the

in the eye and saying, “My dear,

I would be so gratiﬁed if you’d increase the
frequency with which you perform cunnilin-
gus on me,” there are indirect ways. Wax
poetic on his technique. Tell  tongue
dancing the fandango on your man in the
boat sends you into the throes of ecstasy. Lay
it on thick. Most men say they love giving

E almost as much as receiving, but they have a

lot of anxiety about their performance.

Did you know (and does he know) that
a clitoral orgasm causes the vulva to become
engorged with blood, sort of like when his
penis gets hard? When this happens, you’ll

have a tighter grip on his penis if you pro-,

ceed directly to intercourse after the munch-
ing of the rug. He rnightbe interested in this

boosting don’t work or don’t appeal to you,
there are even more subversive ways. You
say you are missing the 69. Why not, the
next time you go down on him, rearrange

. yourself into a 69 position so that .his face is

directly next to your pleasure garden? He’ll
probably get the idea. A

If you really feel that he’s being callous
to your needs, try this:’Explain to him that
the nature of intercourse means that he gets
to have an orgasm every time you make
love, but you only get to have them when he

You won’t have Ben Rubin to kick around anymore

“After dragging Ben down the stairs multi-
ple times, I was sorry to see that he got into
college. Then I reminded myself that he was i
going to Pittsburgh, and felt
proud that I’d succeeded in
making him mildly retarded.
Even so, Ben has managed to
write some very interesting
columns that we Rubins have
enjoyed as a family. Reading -
about my wife’s ‘vaginal

printed on such cheap—ass paper, I wouldn’t
have to fold ‘em so many times before stické ’
ing them in my butt.”

—- Gabe Rubin, older brother

“Ben Rubin was my student in his freshman
year, in General Writing. He was smart and
lively, and I remember saying to him, ‘Ben,
having a strong opinion is not necessarily
the same thing as being thoughtful.’ Thus
began the career of a columnist.”

—— David Bartholomae, Professor and Chair
of the Department of English

“As a fonner Pitt News writer, I recall the
days with Ben Rubin at the ofﬁce, when he
and I ruled that place like Bugsy Siegel and
Lucky Luciano. But maybe that’s because
we were pretty much the only Jew and
Italian in the newsroom.” ’

—- Mario Machi, medallion-wearing meat-

only complaint about the

columns is that, if they weren’t “Where do I begin to speak of

my undying love and devotion to the writ-
ings of Ben Rubin? Well, not here, tl1at’s for
sure. Ben, the Irish have a saying for the
likes of you: ‘If you know ‘so much, what in
God’s name are you doing in Ireland?’ OK,
I’m lying, but go forth now and inﬂict your

Post—Gazette.

. “In The Pitt News, Ben’s column is around

15 inches, but in his pants, it’s a lot more dis-
appointing.”
— Dave Yankelewitz, jealous boyfriend

“If the'criterion for judging a great news-

man are a depravedinability to communi-
cate with women and having ass pimples,
Rubin is tops in the national pantheon. And
yet, writing about his dog’s diarrhea or the

summer he spent stealing breadsticks from_

the Olive Garden hasn’t "garnered him the

   

recognition of his peers that one might have
expected. No Pulitzer Prize is forthcoming
for his column railing against the evils of
one—ply toilet paper. Regardless, Rubin is
the people’s choice. When he writes, ‘I
spend most of my life dodging work and
masturbating onto my stomach,’ he speaks
to Joe Blow and Jane Average more than

_ Randy Cohen ever could with his ‘ethics’

and ‘subtle wit.’ I know, for my part, reading
Ben’s column is the only thing keeping me
from going over the edge. If not for him, I’d
have sent those nude self-portraits to Fran
Drescher a long time ago.”

“I hated this kid — always making fun of
me. Well, thank goodness he’ll ﬁnally be out

Former customers upset with Panera

My wife and I were regular morning
customers at Panera on Forbes until now.
We read Jonathan Check’s article with a
great deal of concern. We liked coming to
Panera’s Oakland store, but will not sup-
port racist institutions of any sort. I asked
to speak with a manager about the article,
but the man I spoke with, I feel, was, to say
the least, indiﬁerent to our concerns. In so
many words, he said that what happened
was in the past and was not a current prob-
lem. He then turned away from me and
tried to ignore me.

As a result of the article and Panera’s
seeming indifference to our concerns, we
urge others to either stay away or to ask the
managers for a better explanation than the
one we received. Racism is not a dead
issue. Explanations are needed, and indif-
ference to customers’ concerns should not
be tolerated. Thank you for opening our
eyes to the problem.

Editor’s note: The Pitt News contacted
Panera Bread Company and oﬁered them
a chance to comment on this letter: They
declined »

Ismarriage reallyabasic  right?
As I read the letter on Nov. 21,

“Marriage is a Basic Human Right,” I _

became deeply disturbed by what seems to
be an’ increasing number of students who
genuinely believe that gay marriage in
America is a good thing. It is obvious that
The Pitt News supports this position, illus-
trated by the numerous articles in favor of

it, but maybe for once, they will be objec— ~

tive and print this letter too.

First, I hate it when people compare
the Civil Rights movement and black
Americans’ 500-year struggle for equality
to the gay rights movement. Let’s get it
straight; race is not something you can

change. As a blackhfemale, believe me, I.
know. Being born gay  still  
puted. Let’s not make the mistake of think-
ing that enslavement,  violence;
and segregation from American"soc’iety for
centuries compares; that kind  statement
insults minorities everywhere. ' _. , "V
Secondly, gay marriages are athreat to
the basic family unit. If a’ kid has two
moms, who is the child’s father? Is he a
sperm donor, or a random guy that one of
the moms had sex with? From this dilem-
ma, all sorts of identity issues arise for the
child, and in a country with an increasing
number of “lost” children, we don’t need
other confounding issues ‘to trouble 0
already troubled youth. — i 1 .
A Don’t get me wrong; I believe gays
deserve to be treated with the same respect
and dignity that straight people have, but ’
let’s not confuse rights with insanity. Sure,
some people say that gay marriages won’t
last or that they are morally wrong, and

Holiday shopping tips for the cash-strapped
Giving gifts on the cheap

CHRISTINA CANN
Staff Writer

C If you’re like most college stu-
dents, you’re basically strapped for
cash all the time. No matter what you
do — whether it’s hustling fries at the
O, baby-sitting for those bratty kids in
Shadyside or donating your body and
soul» to Novumfor research studies —
the balance of your checking account
j.u_s.t_ keeps dwindling to practically
nothing. And; with the lovely holiday

0 season upon us, you’re more [stressed-

out than ever, wondering how on
Earth you’re going to afford presents
for your parents, siblings, grandpar-

. ents, friends, significant others and

Pitt celebrities you’ve been stalking
since the beginning of fall semester.

Well, have no fear; the Poor

Person’s Guide to Gift Buying is
here! Here you’ll find suggestions to
make everyone on your gift list happy
without making you extremely bitter
at having» to part with your hard-
earned cash. ~ —

Make your own presents

I know, it sounds so third grade.
Butlif you want to start 2004 off with
your bank account still intact, this is a
pretty good way to go about it. No
one’s asking you to . .
paint a masterpiece of N ~ 
your best. friend or ‘
whittle a complete .
dining room set 
out of mahogany =’  C
Wood for your 
parents, but you 
can do other 
things. For your '—
boyfriend or girl- 
friend, you can 
make a scrap- 
book containing  I ”
s e n t i In e n t al
items, like pictures .
of the two of you, ‘
or the movie ticket
stubs from your is
first date. If
you’re knitting-
inclined, Why’ not make
a scarf for your sister? And if
you rival Emeril for finesse in the
kitchen, bake some food and give it to
your friends for the holidays.

 
 
  
 
 
  
  
  
  
 
 
 
  
  
  
   

 
 

Secret Santa T
My friends and I

everyone buy _a gift for every‘ other

I person in our group, we would each

choose one name from a hat and only
buy something for that person, and it
worked out really well. We imposed a
spending limit of $20, and gathered
together to exchange the gifts
Christmas‘-night. It’s a good way to
ensure that yousee all your friends
from home during, break, and since no
one knows who’s buying» for whom,
there’s a little mystery in themix as
well.

Shop economically

You’d be amazed at the treasures
you can find in thrift stores and bar-
gain basements. Head to the nearest
Goodwill and sift through the racks
for funky clothes to give to your
friends. Or go somewhere like
Filene’s Basement and raid the store
for good deals. If you go this route,
however, be prepared’ to spend plenty
of time and energy looking for the

~ perfect gift.

Announce to your- family and
friends that, since you didn’t see a
dime of
_ President
 Bush’s mas-
 sive, multi-
 billion dollar
tax cut earlier
.. this year, you
‘~}.}f don’t see how
 they could pos-
 sibly expect you
to afford presents
’ for everyone when
you’re living on a
- meager college stu-
dent’s budget
But be sure to
_ let them know-
- you’re still expecting-»
tons of presents from
them. Prepare
_~ yourself for hos-.

ing.

The fine art of re- gifting

ASHLEY MCGUIRE
‘ Staff Writer

A visit with my family over
Thanksgiving break got me to think-
ing. You know that feeling? You
wake up at the crack of dawn
Christmas morning. Perhaps snow is
falling. You jump out of bed in your
stocking feet and run to jump on

your parents’ bed. Perhaps screaming

for your siblings to wake up. Okay, if
you were five. ‘ »

pulling all your ' lg
sheets off you, and ~ - .
blinding you with '
sunlight. After all, it was
Christmas Eve the night before, and
you’re struggling with the afteref-
fects of one too many cups of
eggnog. Ah — it’s a wonderful life.

But it truly is, as you trip down
the stairs, hobbling over to the cof-
feemaker with one eye open. You’ve
already forgotten about the drinks
you had last night because you think
you might pee your pants, waiting to
see the look on the faces of your
family members as they tear into the
presents you put quite a lot of
thought into.

‘So maybe you went out the day

-before, but_still, you know your

father’s going to love that “#l Dad”
troll" you bought him. And your
mother? Who wouldn’t want a
potholder made in Mexico?
And then it happens.
The anticipation

ends even

before it begins. That fake-joyful

smile your dad makes as he unwraps
your duct—taped and newspaper-
wrapped troll and counterfeits that
smile of gratitude. Perhaps he even
goes as far as to chuckle. In actuali-

 
 
  
 
  
  
 
      
 
  
  

ty, he’s displaying that well-known_

sign, saying that Christmas can be
over now that he has received your
present.

But stress no more. Hide your
embarrassment. No longer contem-
plate why you didn’t buy him the
“Somebody in Pittsburgh Loves Me”
mug at the rest stop instead of the
troll.

Thankfully, in a con-
versation with my uncle
over cranberry sauce,

I learned a few
’ things about buying
the perfect gift this

Christmas.
, These are
merely sugges-
tions to gift giving that
won’t have you running to the mall
or annoying the operators of QVC.
Start a new holiday tradition.-Begin
to re-give gifts. -

Guidelines to the Art of Re-
Gifting:

Rule 1: “The given gift should never
be re-given to the original gift
giver.” '

Rule 2: “When given a crappy gift,
re-give this gift to a person you
would never, want to receive a gift
from.” I

. Rule 3: “If caught re-gifting, always

blame family history of insanity or
fake narcolepsy.”

Apparently, this has worked for
my uncle for years. Just be sure
you’re the person re-gifting, so as
not to get the ugly knitted sweater
passed down from your great-aunt.
And a warning, though I shouldn’t
have to tell you. Never re-gift food.
An ugly sweater is one thing. Food
poisoning is quite another.

I guess giving truly is better than
receiving.

Not quite 88 miles an hour

Not Exotic

Dolorean

YepRoc Records

72ni‘r1/2

Recommended if you like:
Nick Drake

Al James, the heart and soul of
Dolorean, claims he is a very happy
person. But to listen to this album, one
is inclined not only to disbelieve him,
but also to put him on round-the—clock
suicide watch. M '

Dolorean, a folky group fronted by
singer—songwriter James, comes out of
Portland bearing gifts of morbid
acoustic arrangements and pensive, dis-
tant lyrical stylings for those of us who
miss Nick Drake. While the group, con-
sisting of James, Ben Nugent, ‘Jeff
Saltzman, and Jay Clarke, each on a
variety of instruments, with James on
vocals, generally shrugs off the conno-
tative designation of “folk rock,” the
sound they produce is largely best
described as such.

There is, however, a great deal of
uniqueness to the sound, as well ——- ele-
ments of country, blues and even a myr-
iad of classical instruments,‘ from cello
to mandolin’ and piano, combine to very
subtly but theatrically evoke the pro-
found sadness conveyed by the lyrics.

Loneliness, distance, heartbreak

and numbness pervade the album.
While such themes are not at all unusu-
al for acoustic rock music, only rarely
are they conveyed with such intense
sincerity and eamestness as they are by
Dolorean. Even the most jaded listener
will not be immune to the simple, hon-
est and unabashedly miserable nature
of James’ lyrics. Radiohead, eat your
heart out.

If there are any complaints to be
made, the mostnoteworthy would be
that the album, for allthe complexity of
its arrangements, does not offer a great
deal of some or thematic variation.
While the fo1k—infused acoustic sound
is indeed well—developed, it is incessant
and largely unchanging throughout,
creating an album that sounds more like
one incredibly long song than an album
with nine distinct ones. Similarly, the
lyrics are unrelentingly morose. While
this does in some way aid the lyrical

impact —— the sheer persistence of the”

misery being one of its weightiest qual-
ities — it does make listening to the
album a rather draining experience.
However, it should be said that, this
being something of a concept album
about a journey into the ugliest depths
of detachment and self—loathing,‘ per-
haps, no moment of respite from the
downbeat sound or words would be
appropriate. At the very least, it

gjoanyg an 1%.“: way‘

might’ve been difficult to buy. —

The sheer, uncompromising emo-
tive content of this release is certainly
its strongest asset, and perhaps that is
what Dolorean is all about. This is an

type of music. If Not Exotic is any indi-
cation of things to come for Dolorean,
this is ‘a group thatwe can expect to
produce some excellent material as

their ‘sound develops over coming

excellent freshman effort, and one that years. _

DMB rocks out in Central Park, and are better than ever

you and make everything somehow
better. He and his band are like
Enya, not so much in style, but in
how they reach the soul.

Recorded in Central Park on

The Central Park Concert
Dave Matthews Band

RCA Records

iktkikik

Dave fans out there, I’m sure I
don’t even have to describe the
sound of the latest’ CD from the
Dave Matthews Band, The Central
Park Concert.

The album is another hit for
DMB —— but how can a band contin-
ue to make CDs that contain the
same songs, only performed live at
different places? Because it’s Dave,
a god. And if it wasn’t for his wife
and twin babies, I’d be married to
him — just as soon as I get the pro-
posal.

This CD is another triumph for
the band. A three-disc set, each CD
contains from six to eight tracks,
songs you’ve heard before if you’ve

been to any of the concerts. No mat- ‘

ter how many times you hear the
songs you’ve memorized ' and
played when feeling down, angry,
elated, sexy or sad, somehow Dave
makes it all better. Whether you’re
just out of a broken relationship or
have found your significant other at
the bar with another the other night,
something about his songs speaks to

Sept. 24, 2003, this CD was the
culmination of 12 years of concerts
in New York City. If you own or
like any of the multiple live DMB
CDs, such as Live at Red Rocks,
then you’ll have a crush on this lat-
est compilation from the band.

Whether you listen to DMB in
your car, lying on your bed or mak-
ing out with your boyfriend/girl-
fri-end, just close your eyes and

Hearing his fans go wild in. the

piercing is common because it’s‘ per-
sonal and hidden. In other words, as
Girone said, “It’s not like it’s going to
get around the office.”

This type of piercing is not
unheard of among students, either. It’s
becoming popular among both the
guys and the ladies because of the
stimulation this piercing creates. Hey,
perhapsyou should keep that in mind
when Christmas shopping this holiday

After listening to this album, you’ll Beg for Mercy

Beg for Mercy
G-Unit
Interscope

1/2

Recommended if you like: 50

Cent, Eminem

Immediately following the demise
of hair metal at the hands of the Seattle

grunge movement, it would’ve been dif— A

ﬁcult to convince anyone that one day
we would once again witness a main-
stream music trend so bloated with bois-
terousness, posturing and insipid formu-
laic garbage as hair metal had been.
Nevertheless, that day has indeed

arrived, and mainstream hip—hop is our

new hair metal. That being the case, G-
Unit is our new Ratt.

Hip—hop follows the same spoils
system that applies in politics — if you
get big, your friends get to come along.
Such is the case with G—Unit, an assem-
bly of 50 Cent’s buddies, many of whom
helped him through the New York
underground mixtape scene to get him
where he is today. Those friends are the
Jamaican Lloyd Banks and the Southern
Young Buck. There is also the minor
presence of Tony Yayo, who is just as
much a member of G-Unit as the rest of
them, but does not appear on this record
much, having been recently incarcerat-

ed.

For better or worse, Beg for Mercy
has been anticipated by 50 Cent’s
hordes of fans as the follow-up to his
nine—times—platinum Get Rich or Die
Trying. While this effort is not exactly
50 Cent’s actual sophomore album, his
presence on the record is ample, and the

very simi-

solo work.

ing is that there wasn’t more of Dr. Dre
or Slim on this album. Not only are the
tracks produced and mixed by them by
far the best on the disc — particularly

strongest track on the album — but the

are shockingly anonymous for such a
major release. Furthermore, not only are
most-of the tracks that aren’t engineered
by Slim or Dre not as good, they are, for
the most part, markedly terrible.

The album, as a whole, comes off
the way mainstream. rap does all too
often, lately —— overproduced and
under-talented. The impression that one
takes away is that, not only are Lloyd
and Buck not especially good rappers,
neither is 50 Cent. None of the intoxi-
cating rhythms and beats characteristic
of his solo work are present here. While
there are one or two tracks that sound
like they could be at least ﬂash—in-the-
pan radio singles, none of them are as
kinetic as the work 50 has been known
for to date.

Perhaps the most disappointing
thing aboutthis album is hoW.‘disgust—
ingly mediocre it is. There is nothing —
I repeat nothing —— new, unique or espe-
cially enjoyable going on here. Lyrics
are all, predictably, about being playas
and gangstas, and, inexplicably, loving
Jesus. The track “Footprints” is a partic-
ularly disgusting self—righteous mix of
all three themes. They are written with
all the cleverness and artistry of a third-
grader. Listeners are treated to all the
stupid fronting that we’re used to --

These Advance Tactics require hours and ours of time to master

Final Fantasy Tactics
Advance

Developed by Square
Published by Nintendo

Game Boy Advance
~i‘ni?r~:i‘r

How does a bored gamer kill seven
hours, on the road? By playing Final
Fantasy Tactics Advance. How does" a
bored gamer kill two and a half hours in

lecture? By playing Final Fantasy Tactics ,
Advance. How does a bored gamer kill 30

minutes on the bus to the Waterfront? By
playing Final Fantasy -Tactics Advance.

Notice a trend?

Skeptics popped up like random bat-
tles after it was armounced that the sequel
to the underground classic Final Fantasy
Tactics wo111d be developed for the Game
Boy Advance. In related news, chiroprac-
tors have had a record—breaking year in

removing feet from skeptics’ mouths. The '

new Tactics is here, and it’s begging for
your attention. ~

In a stark contrast from its predeces-
sor’s'» long-winded plot and pages upon
pages of back story, FFTA starts you off
slow: you’re a kid, your-friend bought a
mysterious book, you get sucked into an
alternate dimension full of unusual sen-
tient species, you pick up a sword and bat-
tle your way to a living. Your clan —

alongside whom you ﬁght —- takes jobs-

for money, searches for rare items and
sometimes squares off against rival clans
who encroach on your turf. All in all, it’s a
nice new system to wrap around the stan-
dard, solid tactical RPG gameplay. The
Job system makes a return, though this
time, your characters must leam their
skills and abilities from their equipment, a
la Final Fantasy IX. _
Graphically, this is a game that is wor-
thy. of "a big-screen presentation. The
sprites are bright, clean and detailed, while
the maps and menus bear the same quali-

ty and polish. If ever there was a reason,

for the Game Boy player’s existence,
FFTA is it. The music is standard’ fare for
Square ——' that is, a cut above just about

. everyone else — though some of the

sound effects, especially screams of
anguish before death, can become a bit
disturbing after several hours.

Once you get used to the controls -
everything’s shifted 45 degrees to the right
— the gameplay becomes an extension of

‘your very mind. Battles become mere

puzzles, and mission after mission will ﬂy
by, as will the hours. Whether you pick the
game up for a long haul or a short jaunt,

. you’ll be able to jump back in right where

you left off and continue for as long as
you’d like, with the option of saving mid-
battle if something important comes up.
The only .—- and I mean only —— issue
I’ve found with this game is a tendency

— for the world-map menus, speciﬁcally

those of towns, to resolve a bit too slowly
for my tastes. I know it’s become popular

to complain about the Laws and Judges,

who randomjlfy] j ” prohibit  rcertain 

actions/weapons/spells at the onset of bat- I I

tle and threaten imprisonment upon trans-

gressors, but I ratherlike having a good’ ’

reason to switch members-in myparty
every once in a while.‘ ’ i g

If you long for good-, ol’ SNES-style
gameplay, if you crave a hearty bowl of
numbers to crunch, if you have ever
enjoyed any other tactical, RPG dating

back to Shining Force, you owe it to your- «

self to invest several hours into ‘Final

Fantasy Tactics Advance. VV1th the winter .

Pitt prepares for
bowl appearance

JOE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

It all comes down to this.
One game remains for Pitt this

. football season and, despite a number

of missed opportunities, the Panthers
can still make the year a memorable
one with a win in the Continental Tire
Bowl. \

A win would mark the Panthers’
(8-4 overall, 5-2 Big East). third con-
secutive bowl victory and give them a

‘ nine-win .sea_’son forthe second year
in‘ a row." The only other time Pitt won’-
three straight bowl games was from "

1979 through 1981 and it has not had
back-to-back nine-win seasons since
the 1981 (11-1) and 1982 (9-3) cam-
paigns. ‘ _

Standing in the Panthers’ way is
Virginia, the fourth-place team in the
Atlantic Coast Conference and the
winner of the inaugural Tire Bowl last
season.

The Cavaliers sit in a situation
similar to that of the Panthers’. After
finishing second in the ACC last sea-
son with a 6-2 conference record (9-5
overall), Virginia was thought by
some to have an outside shot at chal-

lenging for the conference title this

year.

Instead, the Cavaliers finished
with a 7-5 record and were just 4-4
inside the conferencein 2003, head
coach Al Groh’s third season with the

team. Close losses to Clemson and

By losing to Miami in its regular

title and a -possible Bowl
Championship Series berth — both
would have been school firsts.
Rutherford knows that the
Panthers missed a golden opportunity,_
but it’s something that the team can’t

dwell on if it is to win the Tire Bowl.

“It’s difficult because you tend to

bowl game. “You try to do a little of

After a poor outing against the
Hurricanes, Pitt’s offense will look to
get back on track against a Cavalier
defense that is ranked 68th out of 117
Division I-A teams. Virginia does
have two big playmakers on defense
in linebacker Darryl Blackstock (six
sacks and 22 quarterback hurries) and

comerback Almondo Curry (six inter-
ceptions and eight passes defensed.
And like many other defenses
have this season, Rutherford expects
the Cavaliers to try to come up with
something to take wide receiver Larry

Panthers fall to Penn State in NCAA second round

RAYMOND NEWBY 8 ,
Staff Writer

The Pitt volleyball team’s thrilling season
came to an end on Saturday with a 3-1 loss to
No. ll-seeded Penn State in the. second round of
the NCAA Tournament. '

A 3-1 first round victory over the University
of Pennsylvania the day before propelled the
Panthers into the second round for only the third
time in school history, but they ultimately failed
to become the first Pitt team to advance into the
regionals. ‘

Pitt 3, Penn 1 .

The Panthers, playing in their first NCAA
Tournament since 1994, started their match
against Penn (20-7) a little sluggish. They man-
agedto rally from a few deficits, but ended up
losing game one, 30-28.

Pitt head coach Chris Beerman chalked the

s19W.s.t.a.rt. 11p.to_«a.1.ack_of;posts_¢ason experience

.for the Panthers.

“They were just _a little nervous,” he said.
“But after game one, they were fine, and we
were able to play our game.”

The rest of the match went the Panthers’ way.
Pitt easily controlled games two and three, win-
ning by the scores of 30-16 and 30-18. In those
two games combined, the Panthers outhit the
Quakers .333 to .051.

Game four was much closer than the previ-
ous two. After a back-and-forth start, the
Panthers went on a 9-2 run to go up 17-10. But
the’ Quakers fought back, getting as close as 28-

‘26 before Pitt finished them off with a 30-26

win. ,
‘ Beerman credited Pitt’s_ physical, up-tempo
play for the win. A

“They played a different style of game than
we’re used to —— a little slower,” hesaid. “We
were better physically, and that gave us an
edge?’

Outside hitter .Wendy Hatlestad led the

Panthers both offensively and defensively, tying
for a match-high 21 digs and leading all players
with 29 kills on a .381 hitting percentage.

Middle hitter Megan Miller and outside hit-
ter Sarah Rollman both added 19 kills for Pitt.
Miller also had a match-high .459 hitting per-
centage and a match-high six total blocks, while
Rollman added 16 digsfor a double-double.

Setter Lindsey Macke was the third Pitt play-
er with a double-double, recording a match-high
61' assists and 15 digs. '

Libero Megan McGrane and outside hitter

Abby Fechhelm both chipped in defensively for

__the Panthers, with 21 and 13 digs, respectively.

Cara Thomason led Penn with 11 kills and 21
digs in a losing effort.

Pitt uses tough defense
to defeatNittany Lions

KEVIN NASH
Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt men’s basketball team
used a stifling defense to hold the
Penn State Nittany Lions to their
lowest output against the Panthers
since 1952 in its 64-37 victory at
the Petersen Events Center on
Saturday. , .

Pitt (6-0) forced 10 Nittany
Lion turnovers and held them to 11
points in the first half. The stingy
Panther defense, which forced 16
turnovers overall, blocked eight
shots and came up with five steals
in the game, allowed the offense to
jump out to a 12-2 lead. ,

Senior guard Julius Page got
Pitt on the board with a jumper,

~ which was followed by a layup by

senior center Toree Morris on its
next possession. Morris scored
again on the Panthers’ next posses-
sion, hitting a fadeaway jump shot
that put them up 6-0.

Penn State (3-2) scored its first
basket when center Jan Jagla put in
a layup, which was followed by
fast—break layup by Pitt senior for-
ward J aron Brown, and that’s when

Pitt’s defense went to work.

“When you make a couple of
shots early, that changes things,”
Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon said.
“We came out shooting well and
took them out of things.”

On the Nittany Lions’ next pos.-
session, Panthers’ junior forward
Chevon Troutman came
up with a steal that led to Morris’
sixth point in less than three min-
utes. Troutman then blocked a
Nittany Lion shot, leading to guard
Carl Krauser knocking down two
free throws after being fouled.

Penn State’s Deforest Riley-
Smith hit a three-pointer on its next
possession that was followed by a
9-0 run by the Panthers. Brown led

off the run by tipping in a loose ball .

that hung on the rim, and Page hit a
three-pointer. Troutman and
Krauser followed Page’s three-
pointer with back-to-back fast-
break buckets, which put Pitt ahead
21-5.

“If we can keep the other team
from scoring, then we can turn our

shooting woes.

figure it’s my duty to slack off now

‘whenever possible.

But my perspective has begun to
change ever since I read a story
about former Pitt and current San
Francisco 49ers running back
Kevan Barlow.‘ ‘

The story, written about a month

. ago by espn.corn’s Stacey Pressman

and published ‘on Page 2 (which, by
the way, ranks just behind the for-
ward pass as the greatest sports

invention in history), chronicled a .

day that Ms. Pressman spent with
Barlow — a day in San Quentin
State Prison.

It turns out that Barlow often

49ers’ team pastor — and with
inmates. The

embezzlers or petty thieves. They
are gang members and violent crim-
inals. And most often, they are con-
victed murders,

Barlow visits with the “good
murderers” as Pressman refers to
them. He talks to them about get-
ting on the right path in life, gives
them football tips and signs auto-
graphs for them." To sum it. up, he
makes their day.

As one inmate put it,,“It gives’

me encouragement that someone
out there ‘thinks I am, in fact,
redeemable.” ' A

This man is a murderer. He
killed an innocent person. And
Barlow’s visit reinforces the
humanity inside him.

Now many of you are probably
thinking that Barlow is a horrible
person. I mean, come on, he gives
solace and hope to convicted

killers. These people .don’t deserve ’

redemption. They deserve the same
pain and suffering that they,inflict—

, ed on the families of their victims.

Barlow must have "no idea what he’s

story comes in. While Barlow was
playing in the 1999 Backyard
Brawl, two of his uncles were shot
breaking up a neighborhood fight.
One of them died from the gunshot
wounds. His killer is now spending
the rest of his life rotting away in a
Pennsylvania prison.

So Barlow knows what it’s like
to suffer the heartbreak of losing a

loved one to senseless violence. He

knows, yet he still visits these men
who‘ have forever damaged people
the way he was damaged only a few
years ago.

He understands the irony of the
situation and he knows that he
couldn’t sit around and chat about
sports with his uncle’s murderer.

And yet he‘still trudges to that
prison on off—'days instead of relax-
ing or shopping with teammate
Terrell Owens. ‘ _

Barlow is a professional athlete.
He’s a young and a pretty success-
ful one at that. If you were in his
place, wouldn’t you rather go shop-
ping for a new Beamer or just take
in the beautiful California weather?

I can say with complete disdain
for myself that I would. I’m not

The first Pitt sporting eventl
ever attended was the football sea-
son opener in 2000 against Kent
State; _

, Having grown up in New
Hampshire and never having gotten
to see a‘Pi.tt football game before, I
thought it was funny that the other
people in the student section were
yelling what I thought was “Kent
State sucks” during the fight song.
It took me about three q_uarter_s to
figure out what everyone was really
saying. .

Two weeks later, when the
Nittany Lions came to town, I
found out why. I

I had been to Three Rivers
Stadium for Pirates games before,
so I had never seen the place filled
to capacity. I thought it was great
that so many people in Pittsburgh
were coming out for a Pitt football
game.

Man, was I naive. .

While there were some people
there to see Pitt, a lot of people
were there to" see the last game in
what has been Pitt’s'biggest rivalry.
That was apparent for the rest of the

season, as the Panthers were unable

to sell out the stadium, even against
West Virginia.

‘In fact, it wasn’t until last sea-
son that the Panthers played in front
of a sellout crowd at home ‘again,
this time against the Mountaineers
in the 2002 season finale. Between
that game and the game against
Penn State, the Panthers had, not
only their opener at Heinz Field,
but also matchups with Miami,

Virginia Tech and Texas A&M. Not

one of those games was sold out.
This year, with such high expec-
tations for the team and one of the
best home schedules in the country,
Pitt was able to sell out a couple of

games but_the atmosphere wasn’t'
the same.

Why can’t Pitt find a new rival?

Why are Pitt fans so obsessed with‘

Penn State that they’ll chant about
the Nittany Lions, even when the
opponent is Eastern Tennessee
State? '

  Anyone looking for a rivalry?

There are other options.
West Virginia is the most obvi-
ous. The Mountaineers are just

. about an hour drive down I-79, and

the two schools play each other in
every sport that both have varsity
teams for. ‘

The schools are evenly
matched, as well. Each team has
won two of the last four meetings in
football. The Mountaineers have
the edge in women’s basketball,

while Pitt ‘holds the advantage in

men’s basketball. West Virginia
dominates Pitt in wrestling, but the
Panthers have bridged the gap in
cross country.

Another school that could be
considered a big rival is right here
in the city. Last Wednesday’s “City
Rivalry” against Duquesne was one
of the greatest sporting events I’ve
witnessed at Pitt.

After watching the women play
a hard—fought game at the Petersen
Events Center, I scampered down to
Duquesne to watch the men play.
Had that game been at Pitt, a fair
amount of fans would have shown
up for it, but it wouldn’t have been
a capacity crowd.

But the A.J. Palumbo Center
was overflowing with fans, to the
point that, in some places, it looked
like the bleachers would explode.

Perhaps the two schools could
add tothat and schedule both teams
to play in. other sports over the
course of a weekend. Add a ‘trophy
-to the event, and give it -to the
school that wins the mostggames
during that weekend. Yeah, it
sounds kind of immature, but it

could work, although it would be.

tough. ~
Pitt and Penn State played each

other every year from 1936 until

1992, then played four more times’

from 1997 until 2000. It will be at

least another five years“ until the
two teams can play each other
again, bec'ause of non-conference

‘ scheduling.

During that time span, Pitt will

play approximately 30 home games, -

and at every game — no matter who
the opponent — someone will yell,
“Penn State sucks.”

Joe Marchilena is the sports editor '

for’ The Pitt News, and he would
like, to thank the Duke for tossing

that orange ball at select Pitt foot- ’

ball players during last week’s bas-
ketball game. Classic!

THE PITT NEWS - 27 A

~ held hearings

Non—BCS conferences fight for
a chance at big-money games

NICK HOUSER
_ The Lantern (Ohio State U.)

(U—WIRE) COLUMBUS, Ohio‘. ~ Out
on the gridiron this season, teams like
Texas Christian, Bowling Green and
Northern Illinois have fought to slip into
the forbidden landscape of college foot-
ball by playing in a Bowl Championship
Series game.

While each of the attempts eventu— '

ally fell short, the fight for inclusion has
moved from the ﬁeld to conference
rooms and Capital Hill.

Officials from the 54 schools not
part of the BCS have formed The
Coalition. for Athletic Reform to make
strides away from the ' current system
when the contract ends in 2006. They
have met twice with representatives of
the BCS in the last three months.

At stake is a major slice of the rev-
enue generated from the four major
bowl games and the television contracts.

Leading the charge in Washington,
D.C., is Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, who
before the Senate
Judiciary Committee. He is fighting to
balance the payouts between the confer-
ences. -

Each of the six BCS conferences —
Atlantic Coast, Big East, Big 10, Big 12,
Paciﬁc 10 and Southeastern — receive
$139 million to split among its mem-
bers for having one team in a BCS game‘
and $17 million if two qualify. Notre
Dame, who competes as an indepen-
dent, is also a member of the BCS.

On the other end of the spectrum,

the non-BCS conferences ——
Conference USA,
Mid-American,’ ’ Mountain West,

Western Athletic and Sun Belt —— are
given $1 million each.

“Where BCS conferences stand to
receive more than 20 times ' what the
non-BCS conferences get, the resulting
competitive disadvantages are unmis-
takable,” Hatch said. ‘ ~ _

. Since 1998, the BCS programs have
shared $450 million, while all the other
teams were given just $17 million.

Tulane University President Scott
Cowen has faced the uphill battle of try-
ing to gain acceptance with the big
boys. After the school’s football team
completed the 1998 regular season ll-0,
instead of playing for a national cham-
pionship it was sent to the Holiday
Bowl to play Brigham Young
University. »

As the driving force behind the
coalition, he testified before the Senate
committee that there are five faults with
the BCS, claiming it instituted a two-
class system in Division I-A football.

He took aim at the system, which _

promises guaranteed spots to the cham-
pions of the BCS conferences, while

schools like Bowling Green or Miami of
Ohio are left ﬁghting to play in the
Motor City or GMAC bowls, despite
each hitting the l0—win mark.

“The BCS restricts competition
among individual schools and confer-
ences. In the past, each school compet-
ed for spots in each bowl, and each con-
ference competed for affiliations with
each bowl,” Cowen said. “Now, the
schools and conferences in the BCS
have agreed with the four major bowls
to allocate spots to themselves, elimi-
nating competition for bowl berths
among themselves and excluding all
other Division I—A schools and confer-
ences.” , .

He also expressed concern for the
lack of an officially sanctioned champi-
onship by the NCAA, the ﬁnancial
impact on the two sides and the restric-
tiveness of the current structure, and he
called for a new system, which would
enhance the entire bowl‘ season.

A NCAA President Dr. Myles Brand
said some progress has been made in the

talks between the BCS schools and the

coalition members, but said the biggest
portion of the payouts should go to the
sides that make the greatest commit-
ment. He said the current structure was
the free market at work.

’ Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delany
testified before the
Representatives Judiciary Committee
that last year’s national championship
shows the system is working to create a
game between the top two teams in the
country.

“Miami and Ohio State both ﬁn-
ished the season undefeated and were

ranked No. 1 and No. 2 respectively in 0

Virtually every poll,” he said. “They
paired off in the Fiesta Bowl and gave
us one of the greatest college football
games ever played.”

Parity has started to descend on col-
lege football in the last 20 years since
the NCAA started reducing the number

of scholarships each program could _

offer. Former BYU coach LaVell
Edwards said the change also means it is
time for a new system. He was the first
coach to be spurned by the Bowl
Alliance, the pre—cursor to the BCS, in
1996. - -

Despite going 13-1 and being.

ranked No. 5 in the polls, the Cougars
were left out of the four big bowls and
sent to the Cotton Bowl.

“Every person in our country has
the opportunity to turn dreams into real-
ity. It’s the reason each of you is here
today,” Edwards said before the Senate
committee. “The reason I’m here is that
because of this flawed system, talented
young athletes are denied an opportuni-
ty to make their dreams come true. And
I believe it’s wrong.”

Failure to capitalize on gamepoints costs Pitt in loss

Volleyball, page 23

4). 1
After a close start, the Panthers
were able to distance themselves
from the Nittany Lions with an 11-6
run. Penn State managed to pull
within three points late in the game
before Pitt pulled out the 30-25
win;

“We played really aggressive-
ly,” Beerman said. “We definitely
came out to win.”

The start of the second game
saw Pitt and Penn State trading
points before the Nittany Lions
were able to open a small lead. But
the Panthers never quit and were
able to gain a two-point advantage
at 27-25. Penn State tied it up at 28,
but a kill by Hatlestad gave the
Panthers a game point.
Unfortunately, they were unable to
capitalize on it and failed again on a
second game point before Penn
State scored the final points and
took a..33-31 win.

“Thatturned the momentum of
the game,” Beerman said of the two
failed game points. “It’s a shame
because if we had won game two,
we probably would have won the

Krauser score

them out of their offense.”

Brown and Krauser led all scor-
ers with 14 points apiece. Krauser
also contributed seven rebounds,
with six coming on defense. Taft
led Pitt with nine rebounds, and he
also contributed the game’s second-
highest point total, with 12. Jagla
led Penn State with 11 points and
seven rebounds. .

Pitt is next in action on Dec. 13,
when it takes on Youngstown State
at the Pete. Tip—off is scheduled for
7 p.m.

match.”

The Nittany ‘Lions used their
emotional win in game two to pro-
pel them through the rest of the
match. Pitt did everything it could

to stay with Penn State, but lost_

both games three and four by scores
of 30-21.

“We played as hard as we
could,” Beerman said. “Penn State
is a top team and they were playing
at home in front of 2500 fans.”

Despite the disappointing loss,
two Panthers set school records.

Hatlestad,’ a senior, had 23 kills
to give her 555 for the year, besting

the previous single—season Pitt
mark of 548. ‘McGrane, who had a
team-high 18 digs, also set a
Panther single-season mark with
595 digs.

Three Pitt players had double-
doubles. Hatlestad added 12 digs to
her match-high 23 kills, and
Rollman, also playing her final
game for theiPanthers, had 19 kills
and 11 digs. Macke also had a dou-
ble-double with 57 assists and 12
digs.

Miller also chipped in 19 kills
to go with her match highs of a .432
hitting percentage and five total

kills. Fechhelm added 13 digs for
her second double-digit dig total of
the tournament.

Syndie Nadeau had 17 kills, 17
digs and a .371 hitting percentage
to lead the Nittany Lions.

Despite the tournament loss, the
Panthers finished the season with a
26-6 record, their most successful
season since 1994.

“Our goal was to win the Big
Eastchampionship, and we got the
goal that we set,” Beerman said.
“I’m'very proud of them, especially
considering the injuries we had
early in the season.”

Pitt defense could have trouble with Cavalier backfield

Football, page 23

“They play mostly a 3-4 defense and a cover-
two, cover—three type secondary,” Rutherford said.
“I’m not sure what, but I’m sure they’ll do some-
thing to take [Fitzgerald] away.” ’

Fitzgerald, who has broken numerous team,
conference and national records this season, was
held in check for the first time this season by
Miami. The sophomore receiver caught just three
passes for 26 yards against the Hurricanes, but was
able to extend his NCAA—record scoring streak to
18 games. 0 1

If Pitt is going to have success passing the foot-
ball, it will have to establish some semblance of a
running game. Despite running for 188 yards
against Temple, running back Brandon Miree was

limited to 27 yards rushing by Miami.

On the other side of the ball, the Panthers need
to find a way to plug the holes in their defense. Pitt
currently ranks 87th in the nation against the run
and has allowed five teams to run for more than
200 yards. _ .

Virginia has two running backs, in Wali Lundy
(4.1) and Alvin Pearman (4.2), who average more
than four yards per carry. Lundy leads the team,
with 839 yards rushing, while Pearman is second,
with 539 yards.

At quarterback, the Cavaliers are lead by senior
Matt Schaub, who is a West Chester, Pa., native.
Schaub has completed 70 percent of his passes this
season for 2,708 yards and 17 touchdowns, while
throwing just nine interceptions. On the other. end

of most of those passes has been tight end Heath

Miller, who has 66 receptions for 751 yards and
five touchdowns.

Whatever Virginia does on the field,
Rutherford knows that the Panthers have to do
what has been most successful for them all season
long. ‘
. ‘‘We’ll try not to do too much and play our own
game,” the fifth—year senior said. “Hopefully, we’ll
be able to go out with a positive note.”
