The three female contestants, all

Renowned author Arthur Miller gave his take on presidential elections and the effects of
pop culture on the way America votes in a speech last night at Carnegie Music Hall.

Famed writer compares
politicians to actors

LAUREN UNGER
The Pitt News

Famous actors of this century:
Marlon Brando, Clark Gable and
George W. Bush? According to
Arthur Miller, this statement may
not be very far off.

In his speech at Carnegie Music
Hall last night, Miller, famed author
of the play “Death of a Salesman,”
read excerpts from his new book,
“On Politics and the Art of Acting,”

a piece focused on the concept of .

politicians as actors.

Miller said television bombards
the American public with a “relent-
less daily diet of canned emotion.”

As the debates become more
rehearsed and speakers use speech-
writers and makeup artists, Miller
thinks that the American public is
increasingly “wooed by rouge, pow-
der and lipstick” rather than ideas
or actual issues. — ‘

But with the recent low voter
turnouts and the nearly even split in
the voting for the presidential elec-

tion of 2000, Miller wondered if the
American public was truly wooed.

‘ The issue of voter interest
moved Miller to write the book.» He
said that by pursuing a perfect can-
didate, voters lost something along
the way. In his analogy, the bored
audience, representing voters, left
the theater early.

He contrasted the Bush-Gore
debates with the “naked clash of
ideas” that Abraham Lincoln and
Stephen Douglas had as they stood
on tree stumps.

According to Miller, the missing
passion and spontaneity of the 2000
election could indicate a larger
issue of apathy.

Miller described the candidates’
personalities as “Bing Crosby with
a sprinkling of Bob Hope.”

Although perhaps good in theo-
ry, Miller said that this “nice guy”
image was not really what the vot-
ers wanted. For Miller this combi-
nation brought about an “absence of

University Senateconsidersbetter

legal protection for Pitt faculty  

KRISTEN DRANK
The Pitt«News

In its second meeting of the
school year Monday, the University
Senate created a committee to eval-
uate the University’s planning and
budgeting system, heard student
reports from‘ multiple governance
groups and outlined procedural
changes to expedite and improve its

own meetings. A

‘Philip Wion, chair of the sen-7-A

ate’s budget policies committee,
recommended that an evaluation of
the planning and budgeting system
be conducted this year because one
was not conducted last year. The
review will determine how well the
system is functioning and how well
the document that regulates that
system is holding up, as well as
whether that document needs to be
modified.

The document states that an
effective planning andbudgeting
process should improve communi-
cation between administrators, fac-
ulty, staff and students while help-
ing the department achieve perfor-
mance standards and enhancing the
University as a whole.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
served alongside Wion as one of the
document’s framers.

“We should confirm that the
system works well and‘ I look for-
ward to working on this project with
you,” Nordenberg said.

Nordenberg reported to the
board that the United Way campaign
is scheduled to‘ begin today. Pitt
donated more than $655,000 ‘last
year, and Nordenberg said he hopes
to see more of the same this year.

He also reported that there is
new talent in the University with the
recent recruitment of respected
scholars to a number of dean posi-
tions. .

James Cassing, president of the
University Senate, announced that
he attended the induction of the
eight new members and president to
Student Government Board.
Cassing said he was pleased to see
the enthusiasm of the students at the
inauguration.

Cassing reviewed issues dis-
cussed at the Faculty ‘Assembly
meeting held last week, such as the
work of the University Press
Committee, which is a non-profit
organization that publishes books

www.pittnews.com

about Western Pennsylvania. The
group has expanded its staff and
moved to University-owned quar-
ters.

Senate council member Nathan
Hershey delivered a report on», the
University’s indemnification policy,
which he suggested be expanded to
provide maximum legal protection
to University faculty members who

r are conducting research.

, SGB President Jeff Alex report-
ed that student government commit-
tee chairs would be selected today,
after the delay resulting from the
Sept. 11 attacks.

He thanked those who attended
the silent vigil held on the Cathedral
lawn and ‘said that a book will be
put together with diary entries of
those who wrote messages during
the vigil. The book will be available
at Hillman Library.

Alex also commended the

University for its reaction to the

events of Sept.11, which included a
memorial at Heinz Chapel and a
series of services made available to
grieving or concerned students.

“There is an incredible desire to
help the victims ‘of last month,”
Alex said.

Curtis Wadsworth, president of
the Graduate Professional Student
Association, reported that GPSA is
currently working with PUMP, the
Pittsburgh Urban Magnet Program,
to establish ways of preventing
young professionals. from leaving
the city. . ' '

Wadsworth announced‘
PUMP will host a party at the Attic,
on Forbes ‘Avenue in Oakland, on
Oct. 10 from 6 to 9 p.m. '

Barbara’Mowery, president of
the Staff Association Council,
reported that the council—sponsored

\ ﬂea market held Sept. 29 was a suc-

cess.

Mowery also announced that the
University plans to hold a college
fair in the Masonic Temple on'Nov.
l. The event is designed to help
incoming students and their parents
by making information about
admissions and financial aid readily
available.

In new business, Cassing said,

any committee that has issues to
discuss in the future should have a
report readily available so there is
more time for discussion. ‘
The next University Senate
meeting will be held Nov. 12.

Fear of counterattacks on cities unique to U.S. history

\

RONALD BROWNSTEIN
Los Angeles Times

WASHINGTON —As the U.S. attacks
on Afghanistan roared into their second day,
ofﬁcials from coast to coast Monday braced
for the possibility that additional American
cities could become terrorist targets.

That parallel sense of vulnerability
makes the unfolding war against terrorism
virtually unique in U.S. history. From World
Warl and II through Vietnam, Korea and the
Gulf War, Americans have almost never
feared that a U.S. military strike abroad
could provoke a counterattack here at home.

But on Monday, even as U.S. war-
planes soared unchallenged over
Afghanistan, President Bush symbolized the
changed circumstance by formally opening
the new Office of Homeland Security with a
grave admission: “We’ve learned that
America is not immune from attac ”

That grim awareness could make this
conﬂict more intimate and threatening for
ordinary Americans in their daily lives than
any war the country has fought since the
early 19th century. But most analysts
believe the prospect of further domestic
attacks is unlikely to erode support for a mil-
itary action that now has virtually unquali-

record everything in her room unless specif-
ically told not to. This forced her to write, “If
found, not to be charted, leave me alone you
assholes” at the top of every entry in her
journal;

Scholinski also spoke about pretending
tobeondrugs,soasnottobeputinthe
“loony bin” wing of the hospital but rather
the drug rehab wing. After only a couple
weeks in the drug rehab wing, she devel-
oped a deep respect for the patients and
decided to tell the truth to the staff.

“Sometimes I spoke in code to get
attention for the things I needed, because no
one would believe me when I told the
truth,” she said.

Scholinski then showed slides of her
artwork, one of which was used as the cover
on her book

‘This artwork has saved my life,” she
stated. “When you’re in a hospital they
repress your individuality and your creativi-
ty.” Scholinski cited a time when she paint-
ed a ceramic dog plaid and wasn’t allowed
to paint for a week as punishment.

Starting with self-portraits, Scholinski
has done many different series of paintings.
Among these were drawings of scenes of
violent crime, seclusion rooms from psychi-
atric hospitals and ﬂoor plans of houses and
hospitals in which she grew up. Scholinski
also showed a series called “Freedom of
Depression” which consisted of drawings

ﬂed public backing.

Indeed, historic precedents — such as
the Geirnanblitz ofLondon in late 1940—
suggest that additional attacks could rein-
force support for the military campaign by
underscoring the risk of failing to disable the
terrorists.

“If anything, it would heighten the
issue,” said Ohio State University political
scientist John Mueller, an expert on public
opinion during wartime. “Because it would
mean the only way to stop [the domestic
threat] is to stop [the terrorists].”

That’s clearly the  public impulse,
as measured in the ﬁrst polls gauging U.S.
support for the military strikes that began
Sunday." In a NBC/Wall Street Journal sur-
vey, two-thirds of Americans said it was
likely that the bombing campaign would
provoke terrorist retaliation. But, strikingly,
89 percent said they believed that pursuing
the terrorists was worth ﬂie risk of further
attacks inside the United States.

Also, the percentage of Americans sup-
porting military action — about 90 percent
— is higher than it was in the early stages of
Vietriarri, the Persian Gulf War or Kosovo.

“The will to deal with this is going to be
the strongest steel that we have,” said

Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who con-

ducted the survey.

and directions on how to commit suicide.
“I was literally rolling on the ﬂoor of
my studio laughing when I did these,” she’
said. ' -
' Currently Scholinski is worldng on a
screenplay for her book and is trying to form

an organization on gender disorder. She .

would also like to publish a book of her art.

“It’s hard to stand up and feel naked
like you’re exposing a huge part: of your-
self,” she said, “but at this point I see my life
as a service more than anything else.”

Rainbow Alliance President Sandra
Telep ﬁrst saw Scholinski speak at a confer-
ence in Washington. p _

“The ﬁrst time I heard her speak, I
knew nothing about transgender issues and
I was just blown away,” Telep said.

Other students came to see Scholinski
because they had read her book or seen her
artwork Keriarme Ludwig, a junior urban
studies major, came because she wanted to
hear more about the topic.

“I think everyone questions something
about themselves at one point, so I think her
story is valuable,” she said."

“I hope students get a little bit more
understanding of gender identity and hope
they understand GID is separate from sexu-
ality,” Telep said.

In conclusion Scholinski said, ‘The
truthislarncrazyandsoareallofyou.
We’real1a1ittlecrazyandweneedtobea
little nicer to one another.” ‘

Yet the possibility of further violence
inside America gave the opening of this con-

ﬂict a very diﬂerent feel than the start of the '

wars in the Persian Gulf or Kosovo. As
many observers have noted, most

Americans experienced those confronta- '

tions almost as video games, watching pre-
cision bombs elegantly destroy distant tar-
gets on CNN. If anything, the nightscope
image that CNN is employing V in
Afghanistan makes this war look even more
abstract: The bombs appear as intermittent
ﬂashes of light against a garish green moon-
scape without recognizable earthly features
— a true darkling plain.

That may be the face of modem war-
fare rapidly becoming farrriliar to
Americans. But the other messages now
bombarding the public underscored the
unfamiliarity of the terrain ahead. The con-
ﬁdence that Bush and other officials dis-
played in the success of the U.S. military
offensive was matched by an absence of cer-
tainty about our ability to‘ prevent retaliation
at home.

Just moments Monday after telling the
nation that the military attack “was executed
as planned,” Bush formally appointed for-
mer Pemisylvania Gov. Tom,Ridge to head
a homeland security oﬂice, charged with
protecting America against counterattacks.

Bush’s executive order, chillingly, charged

the new oﬂice with developing plans not ’

only to “prevent and protect against” terror-
ist attacks butto “respond to and recover
from” them.

Just hours later, Attorney General John
Ashcroft announced that federal and local
officials were now “on the highest level of
alert” against the risk of terrorist retaliation.
As if to underscore the danger, the White
House decided to keep Vice President Dick
Cheney away from Ridge’s swearing-in cer-
emony to reduce the risk that both he and
Bush could be sirnultaneouslytargeted.

In another measure of the capital’s anx-
iety, Rep. Brian~ Baird, D—Wash., plans
Tuesday to introduce a constitutional
amendment establishing a procedure for

governors to replace members of the House -

if more than a quarter of the lawmakers are
killed or disabled at one time.

Now, with Osarna bin Laden, the sus-
pected mastermind of the Sept. 11 hijack-
ings,- threatening more attacks, the U.S.
faces a very different environment.

“It is. the deepest feeling of vulnerabili-
ty that the country as a whole has ever felt,”

says James Chace, a professor of intema-_

tional relations at Bard College and author
of “America Invulnerable,” a book on the
nation’s quest for “absolute security.”

Instead of Crosby, Miller
cited Brando as
perhaps a better

Brando figure is

Life goes on,
and so must the Emmys

Once again, the Emmys have been
delayed —— this time, maybe indeﬁnitely.

This year’s show was originally
scheduled for Sept. 16. But in light of the
attacks on New York and Washington the
week before, the show’s organizers
rescheduled it for last Sunday.

But by noon that day, reports of the
bombing of Afghanistan had hit the air-
waves. By that afternoon, the show’s
organizers had postponed it again. Like
the sports cancellations the weekend after
the attacks, this one happened for reasons
of decorum. But this had an added twist:
The show’s organizers did not want to
compete with images emerging from
Afghanistan.

As of press time, no one had yet
made a decision on cancellation.

Shortly after Sept. 11, almost every-
one — including this newspaper — advised
Americans to continue with their daily
lives, despite all that has happened. The
University resumed classes Sept. 12. The
NFL and MLB resumed their schedules
and even plan to make up lost games. The
NHL started its season on time.

The Emmys should be no different.

The Emmys, like sports, are an
enjoyable part of American life. Like
sports, they provide an escape, something
we all need right now.

The show can — and should — still be
done tactfully and respectfully, even in
light of the tragedy. .

The celebrities scheduled to appear at
Sunday’s show were told to wear busi-
ness attire instead of formal wear, and the
show was to have tributes interspersed m
it. ’

' The Emmys’ organizers should be
careful that any rescheduled show main-
tains tact. Celebrities should be sure that
they don’t use the show as a political
forum. The show is about entertainment,
not celebrities pontiﬁcating on how they
want to bomb Osarna bin Laden person-

ally or how they think we deserved the _

attacks.

They should follow the example of
“America: A Tribute to the Heroes,” a
telethon that aired Sept. 21, two Fridays
after the attacks. It featured a host of
famous people, but even the most notori-
ously political of them did not make state-
ments, and it was conducted tastefully the
entire time. .

Perhaps the awards should also
include fund-raising like the telethon did.

As many have said during the last

four weeks, life should continue but with -

a mindfulness of the circumstances. The
Emmys should do the same. ‘ L
_ The show must go on.

Homecoming royalty archaic  

It’s that time of year again. Days
become shorter and colder, the leaves fall
and we dig our wool sweaters out of the
mothballs. And campus is. yet again cov-
ered with posters advertising candidates
for homecoming king and queen.

The election for homecoming king
and queen is an archaic tradition that no
longer serves any pmpose.- The posters
themselves prove this. They show the can-
didates —-— who, in most cases, were prob-
ably nominated for being the

have a talent portion. And at least Miss
America commits herself to a year of ser-
vice and public speaking.

By contrast, your king and queen will
accept their titles and then return to their
cool and glamorous lives, now reassured
that they are, in fact, the two most attrac-
tive students at Pitt. .

I understand that homecoming and its
surrounding festivities can be a way of
raising school spirit. Even I —— who is,
admittedly, not much of a

most attractive or popular
members of their fraternities
or sororities —— trying their
hardest to look the sexiest.
Many, female candidates
seem to believe their major
selling point is their cleavage.

Why do we even still
have an election for home-
coming king and queen? It
hardly beﬁts an institution

ing rally and football game last

choose two people to represent
our school at homecoming, we
need to select them based on
more than physical appear-
ance. If we want to choose
people to represent our student

dedicated to higher learning.

In high school, the homecoming elec-
tion was a silly popularity contest But
now, it’s even more ridiculous. At least in
high school you probably knew the candi-
dates and could pretend you based your
vote on more than just their good looks.

The average Pitt student may know
one or two of the candidates in passing. So
the only thing most potential voters know
about the candidates is how good they look
photocopied and plastered all over carn-
pus.

The competition for homecoming-

king and queen is worse than a high school
student council election. At least student
council candidates are obliged to promise
something other than representation that
your school boasts good-looking students.

The Miss America pageant has been
criticized as a shallow contest, but it does

body, we should choose stu-
dents who are rtmning organizations,
active in volunteering or doing other things
to make a positive impact on our commu-

nity. If we are going to choose two people .

to rally behind as symbols of our school,

they shouldbe more than just pretty faces.

I am not saying the candidates for
homecoming king and queen do not nec-
essarily possess the qualities I just listed.
But’ if they do, you would never know it

. from the posters. Right now, the election

for homecoming king and queen is nothing
but a gloriﬁed beauty pageant ——l and
there’s not even a talent portion.

Despite possible claims to the contrary,
Nancy Reddy did not write this column
simply because she is still bitter about her

landslide defeat in her sixth-grade student

council election.

“W-w-what are you?”

It is asked benignly enough, a ques-
tion made casual by its frequency.
Everyone always begins hesitantly, not
wishing to pry or offend. Still, the query
clearly carries a meaning more signiﬁ-
cant than its three short words.

“I’m sorry, I’m afraid I don’t know
what you mean,” I say.

I know precisely what they mean.
This is" never the expected reply, throw-
ing a curve ball to an unprepared batter.

“Uh  you know  where do your

'parents come from? Your family? Do
you speak any other languages?”

These are not icebreakers, getting-
to-know-‘you questions. They are
requests for a simple declaration. In
D.C. terms, “What are you?” is a
euphemism for “Please state your
name, address and race.” Here are the
options: black, white, Latin, Asian, bi-,
tri- or even quadri-racial. Select one
option. Assign race and rank in a single
statement.

At this stage, I warm up to the pos-
sibility of along dialogue. The worst
outcome will only reinforce what I
already believe about the sharp, race-
based classiﬁcations used in
Washington. The best might change my
opinion. Rolling my shoulders like a
boxer expecting a hard-won victory, I
keep my answers vague and continue:

THE PITT‘ NEWS

“Well, my mom is from Pittsburgh
and my dad is from Atlanta. Most of my
family is still around those, areas. I
speak‘ enough Spanish to navigate
around my best friend’s neighborhood.”

Hearing that, their faces speak their
thoughts. They visibly stumble through
ways to rephrase the question. They
grow tense, plowing lines through their

mon experience in a racially divided
city. I see them searching, through my
torrent of curly hair, my olive skin, my
thick lips and nose, for a piece of them-
selves.

themselves along lines that might work

to one side. I know what
that means; I know the
game. By now, they have

liberal or conservative
mean little in a town that

ty. The largest group of
D.C. Republicans I have
ever seen in one place is my
friend’s family at dinner.
These. labels are inconse-
quential in a city where

tus, I revelin my ambiguity.
Dropping people into racial pigeon-
holes, with little room to move or
breathe, seems to be a citywide pastime.
People pack others tightly into rolls, as
if sorting coins to exchange for bills -at
the bank. I refuse to nickel, dime and
penny my identity away so freely, but I
understand the cause of their search.

_ My high school yearbook cites a
quote from the Talmud that embodies
this interest: “We do not see things as
they are. We see them as we are.” The
inquirers want to see me as someone

nearly everyone shares the
same political values.

Wisdom tells us not to believe
everything that we see. The District is a
place that sees things solely through the
lens of its own racial and political
beliefs, and this town has developed a
taxonomy for classifying its residents.
Visually, this chart would resemble a
phylogenic tree, with each racial, ethnic
and national allegiance in its own sepa-
rate cubby.

In this city, our peas cannot touch
our com. In the District, we need clear

favors the political left, civil ‘

deﬁnitions of who and what people are,
so that we can then orient them within

those parameters. We chart, map and_
diagram in order to find ourselves with-

in the city’s racial and social schemata.

Still, labels prove laughable in try-

ing to sort out thousands of years of
family history into one catch phrase, no
matter how well meaning it might be.
Attempts to sort, list and classify others
only reduce a person to a label.‘

I refuse to be takenat face value. I
am not X-Y-Z, one-two-three or do-re-
mi. Those standards are not a ﬁt mea-
sure of anyone’s ideas, values or expe-
rience. A category-makes no mention of
my addiction to card games, my little
sister who inherited all the tall genes or
my penchant for all things anirnal-print.

Who I am cannot be encompassed
in what I am. I no longer play the game.
Now, when. people ask, “What are

you?” my answer is simple, direct and

ﬁtting with my D.C. heritage, echoing
years of other Washingtonians hesitant
to divulge information: '

_“I’m sorry, I’m not at liberty to
say.” ’

War on terrorism creates dubious allies

Once again, we’re cavorting with
the devil. 4

Throughout the Cold War, the
United States repeatedly made allies
with dictators and violated our values in
the name of ﬁghting communism.

We’re doing the same now — this
time in the name of .the war against ter-
ror.

During the Cold War, we supported
brutal dictators like Mobutu Sese Seko
in Zaire and Augusto Pinochet in Chile.
For whatever else they were — klepto-
crats, murderers, etc. —' they were also
anti—communists, and that was all that
mattered to us.

Even in Afghanistan, a country we
are now attacking, we supported bands
of fundamentalist Muslims fighting
Soviet occupation during the 1980s.
Among those we trained was a young
Saudi millionaire named Osama bin
Laden.

As the discemable enemy — com-
munism —- disappeared over the last 10
years, we haven’t supported dictators to
the extent we had previously.

But that changed Sept. 11.

Since that day, the Bush administra-
tion has repeatedly stated that countries

i.v.::. :.:y..

I:/-I/«

are either for or against us. By using
such black-and-white terms,‘ the adrnin—
istration is doing the same thing that
policymakers during the Cold War did:
dividing the world into two camps
based onone criterion.

Whether it be ideological agree-

greatest ally in the war against terrorism
—— not necessarily because of support
for us, but because of its strategic
importance as Afghanistan’s southern
neighbor.

So why would Musharraf support
the United States, even though this may’

ment or simple fear of
our power, much of the
world has lined up behind ’
us. In exchange for their
help against terrorism,
we’re overlooking the
same things we did dur-
ing the Cold War.

Take Pakistan as an
example. In 1999, Gen.
Pervez Musharraf over-

lead to ‘his , overthrow?
Because we’re generous to our
friends. ’ _
According to the Oct. 5
New York Times, the United
States gave Pakistan $100 mil-
lion in foreign aid after joining
us, with the Bush administra-
tion asking Congress for
another $500 million.
Receiving $600 millionin aid

 

threw the elected govem-

-ment and made himself dictator. The

United States had cut off foreign aid a
year before because of Pakistan’s
nuclear tests. Because Pakistan had a
government that subverted established
democratic procedures, its testing of
nuclear weapons and its support of the
Taliban in Afghanistan, our support of it
had reached an all-time low.

That is, before Sept. 11’s attacks.

Since then, it has become perhaps our

plus the United States feigning
ignorance of his abuses in exchange for
Pakistan’s cooperation equals one good
deal for Musharraf.

In the" last few days, he has shown
that he remains a dictator by illegally
extending his tenure as the army’s chief
of staff, promoting two generals who

, support him and detaining one of his

major opponents, according to the Oct.
8~New York Times. But as long as he

keeps singing our song, we turn a blind

/4.:

for America

in the Cold War. Last week, Secretary of

"State Colin Powell asked the emir of

Qatar, a small nation on the Persian
Gulf, to put pressure on the indepen-
dently-run al-Jazeera television network
there because it tends to give airtime to
anti-American 0t. 5. V —

Al-Jazeera is one of the few inde-
pendent networks in the region. A coun-
try that values freedom of the press as
much as ours does should not be hypo-

, critical by asking another government to

use pressure to inﬂuence the media. But
once again, this is the war on terrorism,
and our values go out the window.
Perhaps we should not be surprised
by these actions because many of the
same people, such as Vice President

‘Dick Cheney and Defense -Secretary

Donald Rumsfeld, helped run the coun-
try during the Cold War.
Go figure that history repeats itself.

Perspectives Editor David McKenzie is

happy that he lives in the United States,
where the U.S. government cannot pre-

vent him from publishing his opinions.

The weather may not have been favorable for
the women’s cross country team on Saturday in
Lehigh, Pa., but the result was. They finished
sixth out of 39 teams at the Paul Short
Invitational.

“It was raining, windy and cold when they
were running,” head coach Waddie Freeman said.
“As soon as they got done, it was sunny and
warm, perfectly sunny.”

The October sky cleared just in time to reveal
three Panthers in the top 25 and in the top 30
overall. The women, ranked ninth in the Eastern
Region heading into the meet, again beat some
teams ranked higher than them in the poll.

After falling to West Virginia at every
matchup in recent memory, Pitt beat the No. 7-
ranked Mountaineers for the second meet in a
row. Pitt also beat Navy and the University of
Pennsylvania.

Senior captain Amanda Schmidt has been a

model of consistency for Pitt so far this season,
being the first Panther to cross the finish line in
every meet to date. Nothing changed this week-

end. Schmidt crossed the line in 16th place fin-

ishing the wet 6,000-meter course in 21 minutes,
47.91 seconds. p —

Schmidt, who was sick most of the week and
couldn’t to practice, still managed a career best
on the course.

Lauren Shaffer and Maureen McCandless, the
two freshmen who have been the main catalysts
for Pitt’s turnaround this year, finished 21st and
24th, respectively. Their times, 21:59.66 for
Shaffer and 22:04.77 for McCandless, were both
personal bests.

“There were only about five freshmen who
finished in the top 25 and we have two of them,”

Freeman said. “They’re adjusting fine to Division

I competition.”

Senior Beth Rocks continued to close the gap
between herself and the top three with her career-
best time of 22:12.12, finishing 29th.

have been sophomore Dawn Hilgert, who
cramped up during the race and didn’t run to her
full potential, finishing 109th.

“Our top four were actually beating
Georgetown’s top four, so she would’ve made a
difference,” Freeman said. But he also said the
strenuous workout he’s been putting the women
through recently contributed tothe condition of
Hilgert, who has consistently finished in the top
50 this season. Georgetown finished fifth.

“I really worked the girls hard the past two
weeks,” Freeman said. _ ’ . _

This weekend in Lehigh was just an appetizer
for what is to come this Saturday, when the
women travel to Greenville, S.C., ‘for the Pre-
Nationals meet at Furman University. Freeman
has been preparing the women for that meet.

With that in mind, -Freeman was surprised the
women ran so well at Lehigh, and their perfor-
mances bode well for Pre-Nationals.

Volleyball struggles against Hokies and Hoyas

JOSH J UMBELIC/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER.

_Wendy Hatlestad had a game-high 19 kills against
Big East Conference rival Virginia Tech, yet her
effort was offset as Pitt lost in four games.

NATALIE KRASMAN
' ‘ The Pitt News

Following through on a promise made after
last week’s loss to St. John’s, Pitt volleyball head
coach Chris Beerman changed the starting line
last weekend. -

Beerman hoped to spark a new chemistry
within the team "and positioned two freshmen,
Abby Fechelm and Gini Ullery, as hitters in the

starting squad when Pitt faced Big East rivals

Georgetown and Virginia Tech.
“I did not bring my previous starters back into

the line because I wanted to make a change from

the chemistry standpoint. I wanted to give the
freshmen a chance to get their feet wet and make
a good future for our team,” Beerman said.

The change was too recent to make a differ-
ence. last weekend as the women“were swept in
both games 3-1.

-They suffered both losses on the road —'

Friday against Georgetown_ and Sunday against

' ‘ Virginia Tech.

Beerman described the team’s performance in
one word — uncompetitive.

He suggested that the women are acting out
the movements, butno one is playingvfor a victo-
ry. , .

‘He addressed the possibility that the women
were relying too much on last year’s achieve-
ments and not thinking about the future.

“I don’t know why we are playing uncompet-

itive. We are playing the actual game, but we are
not playing to win,” he said.

“We sit back and hope the other team makes a
mistake in order to win. Hopefully, tinkering with
the line will create a much needed spark.”

Pitt vs. Georgetown

To open up the game against Georgetown,
Beerman put 6-foot Fechelm on the left side by
Wendy Hatlestad and positioned 5-foot-10-inch
Gini. Ullery on the right side opposite setter
Carrie Norris. ’ p

In their new locations, the freshman duo
recorded team highs.

Fechelm had 10 kills and digs, notching her
first career double-double and Ullery recorded 13
digs — a team high.

Carrie Norris led the team with 41 assists and
Hatlestad smashed 17 kills. V

The Panthers fell hard ‘to the Hoyas in a 30-18
upset. The women also recorded a game-low six
kills and 27 touches.

The Panthers clicked a little more in match
two.

They returned the favor back to Georgetown
with a 30-19 win, tying the match.

The Hoyas racked up their lowest attack of the
game, killing only eight of the Panthers’ attempts
in the second match.

The lights were shut out on the Panthers’

Ripken took a lot of advice

when the Orioles were a winning

career on Saturday in a 5-1 loss to
the Boston Red Sox.

Ripken is well known for his
record of consecutive games played
when he shattered Lou Gehrig’s pre-
vious 2,130 mark. Ripken started
this streak May 30,1982 and tied and
broke the record on Sept. 5 and 6,
1995, respectively. His streak ended
at 2,632 games when he did not play
against the New York Yankees on
Sept. 20, 1998.

It’s phenomenal that a player
could go 16 years without a day off.

There were some close. calls to
the end of the streak. Ripken twisted
his knee in 1993 in a brawl with the
Seattle Mariners. Ripken had minor
nagging injuries all through the
streak.

Ripken was ejected in the first
inning of a game in September 1987,
but since he completed one inning it
counted as a game played.

Ripken won the Rookie of the
Year award in 1982 and was the
American League’s Most Valuable
Player in 1983 and 1991. He won the
Gold Glove Award in 1991 and 1992

win the game. Priestley was 10-19 passing for
161 yards and a touchdown pass, but he threw
two‘ ‘interceptions.

“After he got past the ﬁrst interception, I"

thought he played very well for us,” Harris said.
“We just had some unfortunate things happen for
us that hurt his overall result.”

This Saturday against "Syracuse, Harris plans
to use the same game plan he has all season. The
spread offense will still be used, and Priestley
will start with Rutherford getting more spot situ-
ations.

“I don’t see us abandoning anything because
I don’t think there’s necessarily one thing
wrong,” Harris said. “Whether it means playing
Rod in more spot situations or whatever we can
give to give our players a better chance to win.”

On Saturday, Syracuse will bring in two
potential starting quarterbacks in Troy Nunes and
R.J. Anderson. Harris is not a big fan of Nunes.

“Troy, I can’t wait until he graduates because
he’s been an outstanding player against us,”
Harris said. “And now Mr. Anderson is starting
instead of him, that’s pretty scary. He must have

' showed them something that Troy didn’t show.”

Syracuse’s offense has a similar threat to the
Panther’s offense when Rutherford is in — the
option. Harris is concerned with just following
the eligible receivers.

“They line up everywhere,” Harris said.

with offense

“They run the option, which always petrifies all
defensive coaches. They have some unusual for-
mations, so sometimes you don’t know who’s eli-
gible.”

On defense, Syracuse has one of the most
feared linebackers in Dwight Freeney. Freeney
will be a great test for Pitt’s young offensive line
as he averages more than one sack per game.
Harris has a lot of praise for this linebacker. ‘

“He’s a great pass rusher,” Harris said. “He’s
relentless. When you sack the quarterback, -that
really helps‘ the other guys out. He’s a load. He
lines up everywhere. You just can’t put a tight
end or two split ends in there and say that’s good
enough.” "’

The Syracuse defense moves its- ‘linemen
around a lot. Harris said he is impressed with the
complexity of the Syracuse defense this year’ as
opposed to previous years. ’ . '

“They do their shareof stunts and moving_the
linebacker around,” Harris said. “They are much
more complex now on normal downs than they
have been.’The past four years, I remember ‘nor-
mal downs were pretty basic and then passing sit-
uations, it’s ‘hang on’ because they have every
alignment known to man.” '

Last year, the Orangemen defeated the
Panthers 24-17 in double overtime. Pitt has lost
10 straight games to Syracuse and hasn’t beaten
the Orangemen since 1989, a 30-23 win at Pitt
Stadium. This Saturday’s gamebegins at noon at

hopes of pulling out a victory in the
third and fourth matches as the
Hoyas defeated the Panthers 30-24
in the third match and 30-16 in the
fourth.

They sent the Panthers home
with their second loss in the Big
East Conference.

Despite the loss, Beerman
thought the women played well with
the adjustments in the line.

“We played good against a, great

team,” he said. “We played two good
matches and two bad ones.”
He praised Fechelm’s efforts as
well. “As a first time starter Abby
was great. I hoped that the positive
points I saw in our team would carry
over in the game against Virginia
Tech.” ‘ »

The encouraging points Beerman
saw against Georgetown did not
translate to success in Pitt’s match
against the Hokies.

The women lost in four matches
and ‘suffered their third loss to a Big
East rival. '

Beerman stayed with the new
line he constructed in Georgetown,
and Fechelm followed through with
another impressive performance,
racking up her second consecutive
double-double with 15 kills and 10
digs.

Norris also recorded a double-
double for the game with 40 assists

Bouncing back in the second

But again the Panthers fell in the
third and fourth matches, losing by
scores of 30-25 and 30-26.

With the losing streak last week-
end, Beerman expressed that no
player’s job is secure and that he is
keeping an open eye on performance
and attitude in his team practices.

“Nobody’s job is untouchable. In
practice I am trying to find out who
is committed to winning and_ los-
ing,” Beerman said.

He continued,“I will see who
emerges from the bunch and works
hard in practice. The players need to
decide who is going to play and who
is not, and I want to see who is con-
fident and can win.”

Beerman is staying optimistic
for the remainder of the season.

“We can still hit a winning
streak and beat upcoming. competi-

“I want us to win matches and

‘ start a nice ﬂow,” he said. “We can

Ripken will be missed

Column, page 13

Baltimore youth baseball players
idolized.

Ripken was born and raisedin
Havre De Grace, Md., outside of
Baltimore. His father was a minor
league player and coach.

Ripken’s favorite Oriole grow-
ing up was Robinson, a man who
also played ‘his entire career in
Baltimore.

I didn’t come to appreciate

.Ripken until last semester when an

associate’s boyfriend found’ out
that I was from Baltimore and he
asked me if I went to_ a lot of
Orioles games. I said yes.

Then he asked me if I ever saw
Ripken play in person and I said

yes, not thinking it was a big deal. .

He went on to tell me how he
admired Ripken and how it was a
dream of his to see him play in
person.

That is when it hit me, that I
had been truly privileged during
the last 10 years to go to games
and see Ripken in action. I took
this privilege for granted until last
summer. _

His injuries in 1999 and 2000
shortened both seasons. _

Ripken started off the 2001
season batting less than .200.
Ripken eventually‘ decided he was
going to retire at the end of the
season. After the decision, he
exploded offensively and got his
average into the .270s. He even

had a home run in the all-star
game.

Ripken is so respected that he
received a nationwide farewell
tour. Each city’s team gave him
gifts and every crowd gave him
long standing ovations.

He ended his career in the on-
deck circle to chants of “We want
Cal!” as his best friend Brady
Anderson struck out to end the
game. Ripken was 0-3 in his last
game and ended his final season
with a batting average of .239 with
14 home runs and 68 runs batted
in.

Ripken played in 3,001 games,
had a lifetime batting average of
.276, with 431 home runs and
1,695 RBIs.

It will be strange next spring
when I return home and go to a
game at Camden Yards, knowing
that Ripken is no longer a part of
Major League Baseball.

As Ripken prepared to make
his farewell speech chants for him
to play one more year came from
the crowd. I wish he would give it

another try, but I respect that the '

man has other things he wants to
do with his life. I will miss watch-
ing him play, and I think both fans
and players will feel the same.
Ripken is a true role model
and ambassador to the "game of
baseball and will be sorely missed.

1 Tired just reading the daily newspaper? Here’s your chance
to make news.

This fall, The Pitt News will offer a series of talks on how to do
journalism. Come learn about how it’s done, and then consider
actually making history by doing it for the University’s onl
independent daily newspaper.

Applications will be available at each talk in case you like
what you hear and want to work for The Pitt News. Or just
stop by, learn a little, and talk with the people who already
edit and write the newspaper.
