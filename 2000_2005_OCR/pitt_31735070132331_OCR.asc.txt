MALLORY WOMER
Staff Writer

It is 11 p.m. on April 14, the night
before taxes are due, and you are sitting at
a desk trying to sort through receipts in an
attempt to determine how much money
you owe the government This day comes
after paying the U.S. government a portion
of your hard-earned money from every
paycheck.

But honestly, do you know where
your money is going?

Corey L. Davison, a regional director
of The Concord Coalition, tried to answer
tlrisgquestion while speaking to a group of
Pitt } students. According to Davison, the
 is a “nonpartisan, ﬁscal watch-
dog orga_nization’—’..-that,is devoted ;.tr7)_; "bal-
ancing the federal budget and  _‘   .' ‘__
of 200,000 dues-paying members 1 of all
political parties. 9 *  ;

With programs such  S’ Tuesday
night’s “Principles and Priorities,” Davison
hopes that, through education, people will
become more aware of the 'need'to reform
the federal budget.  ._..  _ I

“What is and is ’not"jdonedoes impact
our lives,” he said. “People do havethe
ability to inﬂuence what elected leaders are
doing.”

‘ According to Davison, 43 percent of
federal taxes collected are from individual
income taxes. And more than 40 percent of

said. :2.   0'

Davisbntadded 'tl1at-‘ﬁle goal of this on-
campus presentation was not for it to be a
“member-drive,” but just to present infor-
mation that is interesting enough that the
Coalition will be" invited back for another
session.

“What I think is most interesting about
these sessions is that in each group there is
a different leader and discussion,” Davison
said. ‘”There’s leadership within the group
that a professor may not see in a large
group.” \

This program was designed by The
Concord Coalition to teach students,
through small-group activities, the steps
needed to balance the budget. VV1thin each
group,‘ members had to allocate federal
revenue to different programs, learning
that it is necessary to sacriﬁce programs or
lessen aid to create new programs that will
beneﬁt Americans. ’ ‘

 

Vote-A—Palooza celebrates
Election Day at Oakland pub

CHRISTIAN NIEDAN
Staff Writer

At the end of Election ,Day on
Tuesday, about 30 people turned out at
Peter’s Pub, in Oakland, to celebrate
the voting process at an event orga-
nized by the Students for a Younger
Pittsburgh, or STAY Pittsburgh, organi-
zation.

“Hey, voting doesn’t have to be old
and stodgy”, said Corey Layman, one
of the event’s organizers. “It can be
fun.”

The Peter’s event was part of a
larger group of events called Vote-A-
Palooza, which, according to Layman,

were organized at venues around town ,

by various politically nonpartisan orga-
nizations as a way of energizing the
younger voting popu1ation._

Other events were organized at the
Club Cafe on the South Side, the
Allegheny Tavern on the North ‘Side

and at the Shadow Lounge in East A

Liberty. These events were organized
by Art Votes, the Planned Parenthood
Action Fund and Red Tape
Productions, respectively.

Layman, who is the founder and
director of STAY Pittsburgh, said that

getting young people to be politically
engaged is one good way to keep them
in Pittsburgh. He added that one reason
many students leave Pittsburgh after
graduation is because they feel isolated
from the surrounding communities.
“When students say ‘Pittsburgh
sucks’,” Layman said, “I challenge
them,‘ and most can’t explain why,
becausethey never leave campus.”
According to Layman, he got the
idea to establish his organization,
which is also nonproﬁt, about a year
ago, as way to connect college-aged

~ people in and around Pittsburgh to the

community through civic and political
activities. A

The inaugural event for STAY
Pittsburgh, which currently has about
50 members from various area col-
leges, took place on Sept. 25 at Club
Laga, with a voter registration action
called “Students Uncensored” at
which, Layman said, 400 new voters
registered.

He's_aid that the biggest priority for
his organization right now is recruiting
new members, and he added that any-
one interested could attend their next
meeting at Crazy Mocha in Oakland on
Thursday, Nov. 13 at 8:30 p.m.

THE PITT NEWS

Banquet leaves some hungry  

LAURA J ERPI
- Staff Writer

The summer after her freshman year,
Maria Wrzosek traveled to Bolivia. What
she’ saw on that trip helped to change her.

V “One of the things that struck me was
[that] one of the kids had a T—shirt on that
said ‘Disney World, wish you were here,’
and I knew that kid wasn’t going there
anytime soon,” she said. 7

After her trip she decided to do her

‘ _best to help the cause.

About 30,000ichildren die each day
from hunger and other preventable caus-
es, according to Wrzosek, who is now a
junior at Pitt. This is more than the total
number of full—time students attending all
of Pitt’s" campuses and graduate schools
combined._ T

Tuesday evening, a Hunger Banquet,
which Wrzosek organized, took placein
the Ballroom of the William Pitt Union to
help make students more aware of the
problem. Oxfam, the Arnizade Global
Service—Learning Center and Bread for
the World sponsored the event. These are
all organizations dedicated to community
service and volunteering, as well as stop-
ping poverty and hunger. Many local
businesses also donated food for the
event.

About 80 students participated in the
Hunger Banquet. Upon entering the door,
each person was given a card specifying
whether they would be in the high-, mid-

dle- or low- income group. They were

‘ then seated in three groups according to

their status.

Wrzosek went on to tell a story about
the general lifestyle of each group.

The high-income group consisted of a
mere 15 percent of the people, being those
who had an overabundance of healthy
food and medical care available to them.

The middle class group was com-
posed of 30 percent of the students and
was described as barely having enough
money to live on.

The remaining 55 percent of the peo-
ple were categorized as low—income. They
were described as frequently being home-
less and usually not having enough fo
to feed their farnilies. B

After the explanation of the social
classes, the students were fed based on the
way their respective groups ate in real life.

The high-income group was given a plen- .
tiful amount of well-balanced food, the

middle—income group" received clean
water, rice and bread, and the low-income
group was given a mere half of a bowl of
rice and dirty water. H
Afterward, the students listened as
speakers shared their true—life experiences
of witnessing the problems caused by
hunger throughout the world. The speak-

ers encouraged the audience to volunteer‘
and join the ﬁght against hunger world-

wide.

nist for The Pitt News.

added. “Therc’s so much liability

“At the time that those [fraternity]

signed, each national organization
contributed hundreds of thousands of
dollars to the facilities that were
built,” Triggs said. -

Triggs added that, if one organiza-
tion receives a suite or a house, all the
other sororities must have one as well.

. “If there’s some _kind of move-
ment towardsororities actually having

~housing, it would have to be a collec-

tive agreement,” she said.

After the movement was under-
way, the sororities would enter discus-
sions with Pitt to find the space to

Defenselooks to fi

The Defense Department is
encouraging American _ citizens
older than 18 to register to volunteer
for their local draft boards — the
body that decides who is draft-
exempt, should the draft be reinstat-
ed -— on a departmental Web site,
according to the British
Broadcasting Corp.

Up to 80 percent of draft board
positions are vacant. So perhaps the
Defense Department just wants to
fill the vacancies. Reasonable
enough, right?

Currently, there is no draft in
effect in the United States, nor has
there been one since 1973, when
Congress ended the practice and the
United States pulled out of Vietnam.
Despite mounting American casual-’
ties in Iraq and waning support of
U.S. occupation at home, Pentagon
officials deny that a reinstatement
of the draft is anywhere on the hori-
zon.

Why, then, canvass for volun-
teers for the draft boards? It’s outra-
geous that even 20 percent of the
positions are filled. If no draft is
forthcoming, there would seem to be
no need for groups to decide who
can be exempted from a draft. It’s
like a fast food restaurant hiring
someone, giving them a headset and

stationing them along a lonely‘

stretch of highway so they can take

worthless spots

drive—through orders for triple lard-
burgers, if any customers just hap-
pen along — sort of silly and futile,
not to mention wasteful.

To serve on a draft board, a citi-
zen has to initially undergo 12 hours
of training, followed by annual four-
hour refresher courses. Someone
has to pay for that training — the
same someone, namely taxpayers,
who just forked over $87 billion for
a nebulous rebuilding plan for Iraq.

Soldiers are dying in Iraq, with
no end in sight.-Our military is fac-
ing urban guerrilla warfare on
unknown territory. Americans,
rightly so, are reluctant to volunteer
for the military right now.

It’s far too soon to imply that the
government "is planning to reinstate
the draft. It would be irresponsible
to start pointing fingers in that

direction — yet. But it’s hackle-'

raising news nonetheless, and iron-
ic, coming from a department head-
ed by Donald Rumsfeld, who insult-
ed drafted American G.I.s in
Vietnam, saying they “add[ed] no
value, really, to the United States
armed services over any sustained
period of time.”

We can only hope that, this time
around, there will be no need for
“useless” draftees to give their time,
effort and possibly lives to a dubi-
ous conﬂict.

No horns, spindly fingers or'Satan chats

I killed Jesus.
Or at least, that’s what I was told a
few Saturday nights ago, walking home
— sober — around three in the mom-
ing. The conversation, between an oh-
so-slightly inebriated boy
across the street and myself,
basically went like this:
_Boy: “Hey! Are you
Jewish?” ‘
Me: “Yeah! Why? Ar
you?” '
Boy (to his friends): “I
so knew it! Dude, I totally
called that one!” General
high—ﬁves and giddiness
among the four boys. V

encountering such a narrow worldview,
or maybe because I’m just that overly
sensitive, but I don’t thinkso.

I don’t know if this boy, or anyone
' fo_r that matter, honestly
believes that Jews killed
Jesus.

Or that Jews have
horns or especially long,
spindly fingers suited for
counting money, or chat
with Satan on a regular
basis, or any of that bull.

More likely, they just
think it’s funny, in the same
way that retarded people

Media overlooks evidence of  WMDs

“Where are the weapons of mass
destruction?” seems to be a fairly com-

imon question ﬂoating around editorial

pages and democratic presidential
debates. The consensus seems to be
that there aren’t any, and up until a few
days ago, I found--myself compelled to
agree.

But that was before I came across
this interesting little congressional tes-
timony given by weapons inspector
David Kay.

The speech, delivered Oct. 2
unveils some shocking things, which
have received almost no coverage in
the media.

The little media coverage Kay’s

report did receive, at least in the New -

York Times and Associated Press, was
some of the most irresponsible report-
ing I have ever seen.

Barely quoting the main body of
the report, they left the impression that
it was an admission of failure. And that
is blatantly deceptive.

At the time of the report, the Iraq
Survey Group had been present in Iraq
for three months and had faced repeat-
ed harassment and “overt intimida-
tion,” suffering three major attacks in
September alone.

I should mention that Kay takes
time to emphasize that this is just a pre-
lirninary report and that more time will
be needed to come to clear conclusions.

He then goes on to describe a
lengthy list of finds, all of which serve
to seriously indictlraq.

As things stand now, he states, “We
have discovered dozens of WMD-relat-
ed program activities and signiﬁcant
amounts of equipment that Iraq con-
cealed from the United Nations during
the inspections that began in late
2002.” —

He talks about “intensive conceal-
ment efforts,” which include the

destruction of hard drives and burning .

of speciﬁc files, in laboratories and

 

companies that were suspected of deal-
ing in weapons of mass destruction. ‘
They have actually found biologi-
cal weapons
agents in the
home of a sci-
entist t—
which the sci-
entist admits
to having
been asked to
conceal. "'
T h i s
same scientist
went on to
i d e n t i f y
another, larg-
- er stock of
agents that he was asked to conceal.
As of Oct. 2, the teams had not had
time to uncover this second stock.
They have uncovered advanced
plans for missiles that would have a
range of 1000 kilometers, well beyond
the 150-kilometer limit dictated by the
United Nations.
If completed, those weapons would
have been able to reach targets all over

 

Will Minton
Columnist

the Middle East, including Cairo and -

Abu Dhabi. .

Two scientists who were formerly
key figures in’ Iraq’s biological
weapons programs admitted that Iraq
had worked under the guise of legiti-
mate companies to produce systems
and processes relevant to biological
weapons and confessed that current
legitimate processes could be altered -to
produce anthrax in one week.

In fact, they found mounds of evi-
dence to suggest that, after 1996, Iraq
further compartmentalized its WMD
programs and that most of them operat-
ed, not under the strategy of blatantly
creating weapons, but of creating a
potential to create weapons that could
be realized in a few weeks time, were it
necessary.

In 2002, Saddam ’ was making

inquiries as to just how quickly they
would be able to change operations to
produce chemical weapons.

Most alarming to me, however, are
the records of a ‘-‘high—level dialogue”
between Iraq -and North Korea about
the purchase of arms.

At their meeting in Baghdad in
2000, North Korea said that they rec-
ognized the difficulties imposed on
Iraq by their U.N. -regulations but
would work “to cooperate with Iraq on
the terms it speciﬁed.”

I’ve barely scratched the surface
here.

There’s stuff about -Saddam never
abandoning his plans to acquire nuclear
weapons and all sorts of other striking
revelations.

You should check it out. A simple
Yahoo ‘search for Kay’s testimony wil
do the trick. ’

So, they still haven’t found actual
completed weapons yet But I don’t
think these findings can be ignored.
And there was that massive increase in
traffic going into Syria just before the
war. ~ .
I think a stand-up comic character-
ized the situation best: “If your mom
tells you that, in six months, she’s
going to come into your room and look
for pot, guess what? In six months
there’s not going to be any pot in your
room.” '

The report does emphasize that
Iraq was being severely frustrated by
U.N. regulations.

For the most part, they seemed to
be working. But for how much longer?

I think it’s fairly clear that Iraq had
potential to become a threatening play-
er on the world stage. But as to whether
that threat could have been muffled by
any other means than War, I guess we’ll
never know.

To the University of Pittsburgh Student Body:

We would like to thank you for your tremen-
dous support of our student-athletes throughout the
2003 football season- Student support of our stu-
dent-athletes is very important to us. Our game
atmosphere at Heinz Field has been electric, thanks
to your enthusiasm and spirit. We are building
something special, and your commitment to our
program is a big reason for our success.

On Nov. 8, we will host Virginia Tech in a
nationally televised game. This will provide us
with a tremendous opportunity to show the country
what Panthers football is all about -—— hard-hitting,

exciting football and tremendously enthusiastic
students and fans who conduct themselves with
class. It is important for our students to be in their
seats 30 minutes before the 7:45‘p.m. kickoff so we

can show the ESPN national television audience a_

packed Heinz Field. ‘ -

It is also important to ensure the health and
safety of our students, our student-athletes and all
fans at Heinz Field. To do this, we must require that
everyone remain in the stands to celebrate our vic-
tory. Our team has a special tradition of singing the
ﬁght song in front of the band and student section.
Again, we ask you to stay off the ﬁeld and cele-
brate our victory in the stands following the game.

Our student-athletes and coaches work hard .

everyday to be a football program our student body
and alumni can be proud of. Similarly, let’s show
the nation what great student fans we have —- fans
that cheer hard and loud for our team for 60 min-
utes but demonstrate respect for our opponent. -

Remember, let’s show the nation  YOU  '.

The Matrix Revolutions
Starring Keanu Reeves, Carrie-

Hugo Weaving

Directed by the Wachowski
Brothers '

‘£r7i‘r1/2

It has all built up to this. Years of
anticipation and wondering what will hap-
pen to those caught in the Matrix — as
well as the months following “The Matrix
Reloaded,” wondering just what the hell
the Architect was talking about — culmi-
nates with the release of “The Matrix
Revolutions.” v

Whoa. . ' ' "I .

Not‘ “whoa” in the sense that
“Revolutions” is going to blow you away,
though it ‘is action-packed and a visual
feast. Instead, it’s whoa — what a waste.

“Revolutions,” in addition to being

—  chapter three in the trilogy, might as well

be “Reloaded Part Two” — this last ﬁlm
picks up where the previous chapter left
off. In fact, the first 20 minutes of
“Revolutions” feels like it belongs in
“Reloaded.” Or in a sequel to “Tron.”

There’s more talk of programs and
what their ﬁmctions are, and a load of
questions without answers. This wouldn’t
be so bad if the questions that were posed
in the previous ﬁlm and the questions
raised here were answered with any sort of
certainty.

A half-assed answer to just one ques-
tion would be better than the no answers in
any form that we get here. All that the
audience is given is a new Oracle (Mary

Alice) explaining why she looks different.

Oh, by the way, the previous actress
who played the Oracle, Gloria Foster, died
during production and had to be replaced.
The solution that the writer—directors Larry
and Andy Wachowski give is a huge cop
out.

Then comes the action. Heaps upon
piles of action.

There’s a ﬁght between Neo (Keanu
Reeves) and Bane (Ian Bliss), a human
infected with the Smith program. Then
there’s the chase where one“ human ship
with Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith) and
Morpheus (Laurence Fishbume) at the
helm is being pursued by a gaggle of sen-
tinels. Then Zion, the last human refuge, is
attacked by even. more Sentinels while
being defended by a bunch of guys in
robotic suits equipped with guns. They
look more like cast—offs from-'‘‘Aliens’’

‘ [than they ‘do defenders of the human race.
Then Neo invades the machine city, which

includes a scene of fantastic explosions
and then leads to the climactic ﬁght
between Neo and Smith "(Hugo Weaving).

The action here is top-notch. The spe-
cial effects are outstanding and make for
an engrossing action movie -—— just as long
as that’s what you’re looking for in this
ﬁnal “Matrix” entry.

If you go into “Revolutions” looking
for a religious experience that so many‘
hoped to have delivered to them in the
final two installments, you’re in for a let-
down. The Wachowskis draw more from
the ﬁrst two “Alien” movies and the work
of James Cameron here than they do on

The Rise of Brutality
Hatebreed

Universal Records

Recommended if you like:
Straightfonivard hardcore

It may be difficult for some
music listeners to equate the band
name Hatebreed with one of the
most positive messages and move-
ments in the hardcore music scene
today. Inciting more than 1,000 fans
per dayrto enter. some of most

extreme" mosh pits in the music

world while headlining the Rise of
Brutality Tour and Jagermeister’s
Music Tour with legendary metal
band Slayer, may not seem very pos-
itive either.

But to thousands upon thousands
of hardcore fans, the members of
Hatebreed stand as beacons for those
who feel tired of trying to follow the
daily trends of music and society, for
those who feel cast aside from the

norm, and for those who refuse to

remain voiceless. To put it simply,
Hatebreed has 'a following of fans
who explode into violent, fist-throw-
ing, dancing swarms of music fans
in every city they play. For those of
you who have been living on the
dark side of the moon for the past
five years, _Hatebreed is a living
hardcore legend. And although all
this may sound unappealing to those
unfamiliar, all of this hardcore
music is created and expressed
under an aura of positive messages.
Lyrically, Hatebreed discusses
issues that range from denouncing
child abuse to calling for wider

acceptance of people. Some have
mistakenly assumed that Hatebreed
attracts racist figures because of
their name. This is untrue.
Hatebreed openly denounces racist
and hateful acts of violence. This
positive stance in the forefront of
extreme music has earned Hatebreed
an almost unprecedented success in
the hardcore world. Hatebreed has
toured with many historic metal fig-
ures such as Ozzy Osbourne, ‘and
singer Jamey J asta is the new hdst of
the“ historic MTV show
“Headbanger’s Ball,” which is now
airing. on MTV2. ,
Hatebreed’s takeover of the
hardcore scene is not something that
happened overnight. Formed almost
a decade ago
Hatebreed toured the country for
over five years on independent
labels — and sometimes without a
label — selling their merchandise
and spreading their vibe from car
trunks. With virtually no outside
funding, no radio support, and a ton
of word—of—mouth recognition,
Hatebreed managed to sell over
200,000 albums before stepping up
to the majors with a sound that can

only be described as absolutely.

With the release of their third
full-length album, The Rise of

Tell Them Hi is better than a campfire sing—along

Tell Them Hi
Campfire Girls
Interscope Records
'>i‘r'7i‘r‘l‘r<£r

Recommended if you like:
Nirvana, Creed

Grunge is back, thanks to the
Campﬁre Girls. From the group’s name,
you would think that the members were
a bunch of Courtney Love-type rocker
chicks. On the contrary, the Campfire
Girls are four 20—something guys.
Christian Stone sounds reminiscent of
Kurt Cobain, only a little’ more upbeat
and with less pain in his voice. Although
Campﬁre Girls is not the most appropri-

- ate name for a band of guys, it suits their

roots. The band was formed over a long,
hot summer full of youth and beauty.
Their music brings out the imagery of
being in the woods with a bunch of
friends, around a bonﬁre, chilling out
and realizing that, at that moment, you
are free, and life is good.

After listening to Tell Them Hi, it’s
obvious that each one of the Campfire
Girls’ songs is well thought out but not

 

overly-meticulous, leaving a raw sound‘

of a garage band in their music. The
strongest song on the album is
“Pedestal,” which is about a man who

‘ holds? the: woman he’-s i';obsessed‘{.with

higher than he holds himself. particu-
larly poignant moment in the song is
when Stone sings, “It comes as no sur-

Ii

-?‘—T.m~ay' have felt 1'-before and‘ make you

prise that a girl consumes me/I hold her
in I build her up a pedestal to put her
on.” One gets a feeling of how strongly
he feels for her and how high he holds

her in his eyes.

There is a theme of rniscommunica-
tion between a man and the woman he
loves throughout the album. On “Post
Coita ,” Stone sings, “I try to tell you I
slip right through your hands again and
again, but you never understand/I’ll
never do that again/I’ll be there until the
end.” Though he tries to get away from
her and her love, he is always brought
back, even if. he does not feel like his
feelings are being returned.

’ ‘P The lyrics are deep throughout the
album and emotion-ridden. The idea
that love is hard isn’t new, but the

The latest version of “Hitz” lacks punch    

NHL Hitz Pro
Published by Midway z

GameCube.
‘kl/2

Heated fistfights. People catch-
ing fire. Checking‘ opponents

through the glass. These are all
things that we’ve come to expect
from'Midway’s “NHL Hitz” series,
but the latest version has toned
down the fantasy a little bit in an
attempt to add validity to its histor-
ically over—the—top series. However,
this move comes with a hefty price

—— most of the fun.

Like its brethren “MLB
Slugfest,” “NFL Blitz” and “NBA
Jam,” the “NHL Hitz” series made a
few. modifications to hockey in an
attempt to create a unique sports
experience. Six—on-six became 4-
on—4, most penalties were a thing of
the past, and checks sent your oppo-
nent sliding, supine, about the ice.
“Hitz Pro” has done away with most
of these childish tricks, leaving the
finished product feeling more like
hockey than a fighting game on ice.

But, oh, how I was disappoint-
ed.

Don’t get me wrong, this game
is decent in its own right. The frame
rate gets a little coarse at times,
sometimes cutting to the bench to
seethe team in suspended anima-
tion for a moment. But the actual
in—game presentation is astounding.
The color commentary during the
game — and the load screens ——
sounds great. The soundtrack does-
n’t get on my nerves. The Franchise
Mode is fun and lets you bring your
own team into the major leagues.
They’ve even included a “Hockey
School” tutorial feature that lets
actual NHL stars teach you the con-
trols. All these things add up to a
nice gaming experience.

But I expected a bloody pain pit
on ice. And I’m still disappointed.
If I had wanted a vanilla hockey\
game, I’d have played one. It felt
like I was at a monster—truck rally
and, much to my chagrin, they’re
just driving Porsches around.

If you’re looking for a nice, vio-
lent, insane romp through the NHL,
pick up an older version of “NHL
Hitz.” If you’re too wimpy for that
and would like something that’s just
a slight bit —— not too much —— more
intense than real hockey, then you
might be able to enjoy “NHL Hitz
Pro.” ‘

Hatebreed sends a positive message

Hatebreed, page 10

es, The Rise of Brutality is very
straightforward hardcore.

On the opening night of the.

current Rise of -Brutality Tour 2,
Jasta commented on the new

album by saying, “Tell all your‘
friends. The new album has no,

singing. No rapping. No soft
shit. Just straight f———ing hard-
core.” And that is the uncondi-
tional truth. . ’
While the album pumps just
over 30 minutes of hardcore
‘dancing themes, one can’t help
but feel that there comes a point

when you can have too much of
a good thing. The Rise of
Brutality pays homage to classic
hardcore bands such as Madball
and Turmoil, taking a refreshing
stance in a musical world domi-
nated by bubble-gum acts. Many
long-time fans will find comfort
in the fact that Hatebreed isn’t

afraid to stick ‘with a formula .

that has worked for the last

‘decade. But if you’re looking

for new innovations on this
hardcore delivery, you are
straight out of luck.

For new fans «of hardcore
music and those supportive of

bands remaining traditional, The
Rise of Brutality will quickly
find a place in your hearts. For
those music fans craving inno-
vation and progression from
album to album, you may want
to leave this one on the store
shelf. But make no mistakes
about it, Hatebreed remains one
of the best hardcore concert
experiences in the world and
will continue to march tall as
the kings of positively charged,
bone-crushing, straightforward

hardcore.

Page shoots Pitt

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

Center Toree Morris scored 

points, pulled down 13 rebounds and
blocked three shots in Pitt’s first
exhibition game as the Panthers
defeated the 320 All-Stars 101-85 at
the Petersen V Events Center
Wednesday night. _

“Toree looked like Shaquille
O’Neal,” guard Carl Krauser said.

Morris, who worked hard in the
off—season to decrease his body fat to
12 percent, went 5-for-5 from the
ﬂoor and dominated the frontcourt.
Krauser said he plans to look for
Morris more down low when he’s
leading the team down the court.

“If you feed the dog a bone,
they’re going to obey what you say,”
Krauser said, “so I’m going to go out
there and get the big man the ball.”

Three other Panthers finished in
double digits. For_Ward Chevon
Troutman was 4-for-8 from the ﬂoor,

 past 320 All-Stars

scoring 12 points and recording
seven rebounds. Krauser finished the

»game with 16 points and seven

assists. ‘

Guard Julius Page came out fir-
ing threes and led the team with 22
points. He finished the game 8-for-13
from the ﬂoor and 6-for-9 from three-
point land. '

It was head coach Jamie Dixon’s
priority to get Page onto the ﬂoor and
into condition. Page has been both-
ered by an ankle injury and has only
just begun practicing with the team.
Page’s ankle injury did not allow him
to run up and down the court in prac-

tices, but he would go to the gym and -

practice his shooting all day.
“I wouldn’t leave until I made
500 jump shots,” Page said.

Page led theteam in playing time i

with 32 minutes. He said he went to
Dixon and told him that he wanted to
put in a lot of time.

Soccer helps keep family together despite distances

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

Pitt against Ohio State is not normally con-
sidered a special game — particularly when one
is talking about collegiate soccer. Although, on
Oct. 24, both teams competed, and the game was
special for at least one player —— Pitt midfielder
Marco Carrizales. A

It was special for him because, when heading
out of the locker room at halftime, Carrizales
turned around and looked up to the upper deck
level of the building aside of Founders Field,
where fans can get a great View of the game. He
smiled and threw up a hand. 1

On the other side of this warm gesture was
Andrew Carrizales, or, as Marco would call him,
Dad. 1

Andrew had just ﬂown in to Pittsburgh from
Texas to see his son play soccer at Founders Field
for the first time. He sat there with his camera in
hand, ﬂashing pictures of Marco every chance he
got. Decked in Pitt sportswear, which included a
baseball cap and winter coat, he cheered his son
on. The winter coat, which featured a large
Panther logo on the back, was definitely not a
part of his normal attire.

“It’s 90 degrees in Houston. I got off the

0d, Marco was tripped up by an Ohio State play-

, er. Andrew stood up, and the soccer coach inside

him came out. He began yelling in favor of Pitt
and in protection of his son. It made it clear

’ where Marco’s love for the game of soccer came

from.

Marco has played in front of his father as a
Pitt Panther once before. Two years ago, during
his freshman year, Pitt ‘ competed in the
University of Alabama-Birmingham Tournament
in Alabama. Marco’s parents made the road trip
from his hometown of Missouri City, Tex., to see
him play. 1

His father is very supportive of his son play-
ing soccer.‘Andrew was his coach when Marco
was younger and has been a soccer coach for a
youth team since Marco was 11 years old.

“He’s always with me, even if he’s not
[here],” Marco said.

When Marco is on the soccer field, he thinks
about all the things his father taught him.

“He was always (with me as a child. He
always went to the games, him and my mom and
my whole family,” Marco said.

On that day, he had half of his immediate
family in attendance. His brother was on the

other side of the field videotaping the game, like
he does every game. '

University of Houston to Pitt. They now share an
apartment and spend time with each other, engag-
ing in various activities. .

“[My brother and I] do all the same things,”
Marco said. “It’s kind of like having. a family
close, [since] we’re so far away from home.”

Marco was persuaded to come to Pitt because

‘of the school’s reputation for excellence.

“Pitt’s a prestigious scchool. It’s great to grad-
uate from,” he said. He knows all about prestige,
having been Valedictorian of his high school
class. _

He looked at many schools in North Carolina
and Florida, but made the ultimate decision to
come to Pitt because it is a member of the Big
East Conference.

“It’s the best soccer conference there is. It’s
great to have a good soccer team,” Marco said, in
reference to Pitt’s 2000 soccer team, which went
13-5 overall and 7-4 in the Big East.

Pitt has yet to get back to that level of suc-
cess, but Marco feels they can get there. They are
a young team and have many players, including
himself, returning for next year. '

_ Soccer has taken Marco to places in the world
that many people can only dream about having
the chance to visit. 1

Morris scores 14 points and grabs 13 rebounds

Basketball, page 14

“Julius always comes out ready to
play,” Krauser said. _ ‘

The first half started out shakily
for the Panthers. They were 15—of—30
from the floor and went into the half
only up by seven points, 49-42.

Dixon attributed the slow start to
the small amount of practices held
before the game. Last year, the
Panthers had 25 practices before their
first exhibition game, whereas this
year, they only had 13 before
Wednesday night’s game.

After the 320 All-Stars scored a
bucket at the beginning of the second

half, Pitt went on a 17-5 run, which
put them safely ahead for the rest. of
the game. ,

The Panthers hit three three-
pointers, one from Page, then two
from guard Yuri Demetris, to help
keep the 320 All-Stars far behind.

“I thought we saw some good
performances,” Dixon said. .‘_.‘We were
really happy with our freshman
group.” ’

Freshman forward Chris Taft
came off the bench, scoring eight
points and grabbing eight "rebounds.
He finished the game with a dunk that
excited the crowd. Forward Levon
Kendall missed a free throw, and

after the ball bounced in and out of
the hands of several players, Taft
pulled the rebound down. He then
jumped and dunked the ball.
“We’re ready to ‘take on anyone in the
Big East, [Atlantic Coast
Conference], or any other confer-
ence,” Krauser said. “We’re just
looking forward to Alabama next
Friday. We’re going to take it one
game at a time.”

The Panthers’
game is Sunday at 7 p.m. against the
EA Sports All-Stars. Their first regu-
lar season game is Nov. 14 at 7 p.m.
against Alabama at Madison Square
Garden.

And after many years of_ wait-
ing, Marco, at age 17, traveled to
Brazil, the summer before his fresh-
man year at Pitt, to train with a
club. _

Brazil wasn’t the first foreign

country that Marco traveled to ‘for .

soccer purposes. At ages 14 and 15,
he went to Bolivia for the Copa
Mundalito — a competition where
teams from different nations travel
in to play in a “mini world cup.”
The first year he was there his
team came in third place, but the
following year "they did not do as

well and,like most others, Marco‘

dislikes losing.

5 “This year has been rough,”
Marco said. “It’s tough not winning
[and] it’s tough not scoring. You put
so much effort into practicing, and
whenyou lose it’s kind of like all
that workwent out the window.”

It has been rough. When he

came to Pitt, Marco immediately‘

made an impact on the team. He
started all 35 games of his first two
years at Pitt registering 12 goals

» and two assists. _

This year he has started 16 of 18
games and onlyscored one goal, but
he runs on the field with the energy
of a World Cup champion. '

It’s the love of the game that

allows him to run out onto the field
with a smile, even with a losing
record. It’s the love of the game that
brings "his family to the sidelines
during a season in which Pitt is
under—achieving. And it’s the love
of the game that allows hisfather to
stand proud after a 1-0 loss and
applaud his son’s effort. 3
