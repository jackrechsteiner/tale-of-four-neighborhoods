Journalists
face more
scrutiny

WILL SCHEFF
Staff Writer

After The New York Times
revealed that Jayson Blair lied, pla-
giarized and fabricated his way
through a short—lived career at that
paper, many people in America —
including journalists — questioned
how the field of journalism might
change to protect the credibility of
newspapers.

“Hardly a day goes-by when I
don’t mention it,” said Ari Goldman,
associate professor at Columbia
University’s Graduate School of.
Journalism and a former New York
Times reporter; “It’s the ultimate cau-
tionary tale for journalists. I’m more
vigilant towards students who are cut-
ting corners.”

Goldman also said that, although
increased scrutiny of student joumal—
ists’ work is likely at just about any
university, he’s changed his mind
about whether it will be harder for
students to find jobs.

“At first, I thought that this is a
bad thing for all young journalists, but
it hasn’t proven to be,” Goldman said.
He described how another Times
reporter, ‘Rick Bragg, was fired after
using stringers, or freelance journal-
ists, to write his stories.

“What’s happened as a result is
that they’re now giving credit to these
stringers, which gives young journal-
ists a chance to shine,” Goldman said.

Columbia’s tough policies .—
which have always included expul-
sion for any confirmed case of plagia-
rism — are echoed by the University
of Maryland’s Philip Merrill College
of Journalism, where Blair attended
some classesrbut lied about graduat-

Recovery Month draws attention to addiction help

CHRISTIAN NIEDAN
Staff Writer

Ronny gave up drinking three years
ago, and he has fought to keep alcohol at
arm’s length ever since. ‘ j

“I didn’t want to die a drunk, so I
joined AA” the Pitt graduate, who asked
that his last name notibe used, said of his
membership in Alcoholics Anonymous.

As a student, he faced constant pres-
sure to drink in order to feel “norm ” with
ﬁiends, acquaintances and strangers, he
said. After reaching a point where he was
drunk six out of seven days a week, having
too many mornings of waking up alone

and depressed, he realized he wasvan alco-

holic and turned to AA for support in quit-
ting

month of September to people of all ages,
all over the Unites States, who are trying to
make the same tough decisions about
drugs and alcohol.

This September is the 14th annual
National Alcohol and Drug Addiction
Recovery Month. ‘

Organized and sponsored by the. ‘

Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration, or SAMHSA,-an

agency of the U.S. Department of Health

and Human Services, the month is intend-

.'Ihe government has dedicated the

ed to educate the public about substance
addiction, its negative effects on public
health and its treatment options.

Among the students who went to Pitt’s
counseling center for substance-related’

' issues during the 2001-2002 school year, 5

percent of the cases concerned alcohol and
3 percent concerned drugs, according to
the center. After alcohol, marijuana is, by
far, the most abused substance, they said.
On-campus groups dedicated to
addiction recovery and education at Pitt
include both AA and Narcotics
Anonymous. ‘

Associate -Dean Chris Callahan
said that B1air’s case is used to rein-
force the importance of ethical stan-
dards.

“All we have_ is our credibility,”
said Callahan. “That’s the basis of the
relationship between reader and news-

Callahan doesn’t think that Blair’s

sors to make sure this message goes

Peter Leo, the Post-Gazette’s writ-
ing coach, a columnist and a Pitt
instructor, said that young journalists
shouldn’t be discouraged by B1air’s
example.

The Post—Gazette isn’t currently
hiring, he explained, but he said that if
they were, they’d “do it gladly and
boldly.”

Treatment for drug, alcohol abuse available, but few seek it

Addiction, page 1

The Personal Education and Referral
Program, familiar to anyone who’s been
cited, for underage drinking’ or smoking

. marijuana, is run by the Student Health

Education Ofﬁce. The Judicial Board and
residence halls usually refer offenders to
the office for help. ﬂ

For the next generation of Americans,
prescription drug" abuse has become
increasingly common. ' The National
Institute on Drug Abuse estimated that, in
2001, 957,000 Americans over the age of
12 had used OxyContin, a prescription
painkiller, for non-medical uses at least
once in their lifetimes.

This estimate came as a steady jump
from the previous two years — in 1999,
only 221,000 had abused it and, in 2000,
399,000 people admitted to using it —— and
researchers expect the number to be even
higher for 2002 and 2003.

I The biggest obstacle for many with a
substance addiction or abuse problem is
the perceived social stigma that asking for
treatment is either a sign of weakness or

H pointless altogether.

The late Harold Hughes, a former US.

Senator from Iowa, helped drive through a.

proposal offering extensive federal fund-
ing for community drug and alcohol rehab
in the 1970s.

“Without the examples of recovering
people, it’s easy for the public to continue
thinking that victims of addiction disease
are moral degenerates —— and that those
who recover are the morally enlightened
exceptions,” said Hughes, a recovering
alcoholic, when he offered his support for
the proposal. “We are the lucky ones, the

ones who got well, andit is our responsi—'

bility to change the terms of the debate, for
the sake of those who still suffer.”

' There are serious socioeconomic costs
associated with drug and alcohol addiction

in the United States, according to SAMH-p

SA. ’ ’ ’

2001 survey put the societal cost at
an estimated $294 billion each year, based
on costs for lost productivity, law enforce-
ment, health care, welfare and other ser-

vices.

Most adult, working-age, users of
illicit drugs are employed —— according to
one study, 77 percent held either full— or
part-time jobs in 2000. , ‘

But employees who have substance
addictions use more workers’ beneﬁts and
sick days, are late more often, are more
likely to cause accidents and are less pro-
ductive than other employees, the study
indicated.

In recent years, there has been a
national controversy on how to handle
crimes driven by substance addiction -
particularly in regards to illegal drugs.
SAMHSA estimates that for every $1

invested in addiction treatment, there is a
return of between $4 and $7 in reduced
drug-related crime, criminal-justice costs
and theft.

In 2001, drug-abuse rates in urban
areas were about one—third higher than
rates in more rural areas. ,

An estimated 22 million Americans
were addicted to alcohol, drugs or both in
2002, according to a recently released
SAMHSA survey. Among Americans
aged 12 or older, 19.5 million, or 8.3 per-
cent, were regularly using illicit drugs at
the time of the survey.

In that same age group, 54 million
Americans, or 23 percent, engaged in

infrequent, heavy drinking, commonly
called “binge drinking.” Another 15.9 mil-
lion, or 6.8 percent, were frequent, heavy
drinkers.

Most people in these groups neither
sought nor received treatment.

“Of the 3.3 percent of all Americans
— some 7.7 million people —— with a diag-
nosable drug problem, only 1.4 million, or
18 percent of those with a drug problem,
received treatment, according to the sur-
vey. Out of the 18.6 million Americans
with a diagnosable alcohol problem, or 7.2
percent of the total population, only 1.5
million, or 8 percent of those with a prob-
lem, received treatment

Senate right to try to overturn FCC rules

Who wants to buy The Pitt
News?

We’re not selling, though under’

the current Federal Communication
Commission regulations, we could be
bought out by either a television sta-
tion or another newspaper.

But the U.S. Senate wants to help
make us, and many others, less vul-
nerable.

On Sept. 16, the Senate voted to

repeal the FCC’s June 2 rulings that P

allowed media companies to control
a larger market sector —— 45 percent,
up from the pre-June 35 percent. The
FCC’s regulations also allowed com-
panies to have cross—ownership, let-
ting newspaper companies buy tele-
vision stations in a market, and Vice
versa.

To change the current regula-
tions, the House of Representatives
must vote, and President Bush must
sign the new bill — although he’s
already promised to veto. Overriding
this veto would require bipartisan
work to get the majority, forcing
Republicans and Democrats to, gasp,
agree on something. This has already
started, as Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-
N,.D., sponsored the bill, which
passed 55 to 40, showing a bipartisan
vote in the Republican—led Senate.

While The Pitt News did have its
eye on several TV stations —— imag-
ine all Simpsons and Wild America

reruns, all the time — we commend
the Senate’s decision to roll back the
FCC to its previous rules.

Quality should triumph over
quantity. The FCC’s June 2 regula-

tions seemed to abide by the golden

rule — whoever has the gold makes
the rules, or in this case, reaches the
audience. -

As a two—newspaper town,
Pittsburgh would be a prime target
for media consolidation, which
would let one newspaper or televi-
sion station either buy their smaller
competition or run them out of busi-
ness.

Deregulating the media would
mean that more information would
come from fewer sources, making it
harder to have a well-balanced mar-
ket. Imagine if 45 percent of news
came from Fox News or The Socialist
Worker or us. Scary thought, isn’t it?

There would be fewer guarantees
of fairness, fewer guarantees that all
demographics are served and fewer.
guarantees that what people watch
and read is the whole truth.

Moreover, college newspapers
compete with other local newspapers,
most with larger budgets and scope.
The Pitt News and its ilk — small,
independent newspapers with a limit-
ed audience — could be bought out.

Not that we’re selling, of course.

Waiter—ing: piping-hot or septic-tank evil?

‘ I became a waiter over the summer at a
franchise Italian eatery, under the impression
that the money, booze, and sassy ladies
would ﬂow like a metaphoric river of good
times. It ended up being more like a
metaphoric slurping of a septic tank of bad-
ness.

Vince was the stoutly muscled general
manager and undoubtedly the reason this job

was so unlivable. He was an insane stickler‘

for details; for example, he once reprimand-
ed me for ten minutes for not having button
on my collar: “Do you know what your job

is here, Ben? You’re supposed _ 

   

to give our guests a genuine I-
talian dining experience, and
serve them _piping-hot food.
How are you going to do that
without buttons on your col-
lar.”

He always said “piping-
hot food.” What the hell is
“piping-hot food?” Can you
serve the customers plain—hot
food, or wouldpthey get pissed
off and send it back? “Look, I come here
because I like my food piping. Can I please
get some piping with my meal?”

Vince said “piping-hot food” so much
that everyone answered every question he
had with those words. Vince: “Do.you know
where Steve is?”_ “Piping—hot food!” Vince:
“Who put this booger on my shirt?” “Piping-
hot food!”

During the two months I waiter-ed, I I

found three different kinds of customers.
First, there’s the unbelievably fat guy who
knew the menu better thanIdid,knewallthe
chefs by name, had more ﬁiends at the
restaurant than I ‘did and ordered three
entrees, then one more to go. I

' Then there was the idiot who —— even
though the Italian wgrds are made so
American—friendly that most of the menu is
spelled out phonetically —— couldn’t even
pronounce “alfredo.” Lastly, there was the
woman who was so old that her body
stopped producing heat, so she needed a

ll Ben 

Columnist

reﬁll of soup every three minutes or she’d
freeze. After she was done eating, ,she’d
slowly shuﬂle out to ﬁnd a nice big rock on
which she could incubate. It was inevitable
that I became a spineless suck—up, pandering
shamelessly for tips. After saying “certainly”
and “just one moment, please” for eight
hours a day, I became this cheery tool. I uied
to ﬁght it and curse sometimes, but the only
thing ﬂiat came out was a zippy, “More
breadsticks? Yeah, they sure are yummy!” ,
At.the end of every night, I’d go home
exhausted, both feet in pulsating pain. I’d
 ‘ drink myself stupid, praying
for Vince to contract polio or at

drank, I’d drink Smirnoff Ice,
because I’m a girl — sad but
true. ‘

Undeniably, the only
good part of working there was
the staff; they were all so
friendly and rowdy, and spon-
taneously broke out in dance

_ parties.‘ One time, I turned
around in the kitchen, and Dante’s pants
were down, showing off his two bare ass
cheeks split in the middle by a thin strand of
hot—red g-string. I’m not sure what he was
doing, but the entire kitchen staff erupted in
hootging and hollering, Jerry Springer-style,
then we started chanting “piping—hot food”
and ran around in hysterics.

_,Ul_timately, Ihope. the occupations of
waiter isn’t taken over by robots or, even
worse, that someone doesn’t invent one of
those food-processing units from Star Trek.
Waiter-img is a good rite of passage for’ all
young Americans. While I waiter—ed, I

 

‘learned valuable skills —— like how to steal a

lot of desserts, to cry without making noise
as the GM beat me and to get a woman’s
digits and then ﬁnd out that she’s a prostitute.
Unlike the others, that last one actually hap-
pened, and I’m a better person because for it.

Imagine being at. the low end of the
middle class in the l960s, with grandiose
dreams that you hope will come true, but

somewhere deep down, you know never

will.

Now imagine if money started raining
down from the sky, tens of thousands of free
dollars just there for the taking. Keeping the
money will mean seeing all your hopes and
dreams come true. Returning it will make
you feel a swell of goodness from doing the

right thing, but feelings don’t pay the bills. ' '

That’s the situation confronted by the
major players in the ensemble comedy/life-
aﬂirming, feel—good ﬁlm “l\/Ianna From
Heaven.”

= Green. Speaking in art, it’s the color of the

‘ world “Matrix II,” a Light-Emitting Diode’

installation created by Australian artist Erwin
Redl and on display at Wood Street Galleries.
The piece is one that quietly beckons viewers to
enter it. It is a space. More specifically, it is a
work that softly depicts what Redl called, at the
opening reception for the exhibit, “the relation-
ship between body and space created out of
nothing.” This “nothingness” is an essential part
of Redl’s motivation.

Disregarding typical western views of space
as being the walls, ﬂoor and ceiling of a room,
Redl realizes that “Space actually is the empti-
ness between the walls, not the walls, them-
selves.” This realization is transferred to his

audience; the walls and ceiling fade deeply into
the background, and it is difficult to clearly per-
ceive where the room’s boundaries really are.
Green. Speaking in photons, it coincides
with our retina’s point of maximum spectral sen-
sitivity, which is approximately 500 nanometers.
This objective characteristic‘ of greenmay have

evolutionary ties to our subjective experience of

it. In primates, the neural reaction to green is rel-
atively neutral — the color of V foliage is able to
fade into the background so that they may more
easily identify brightly colored fruits. For Redl,

the “emotionally neutral” aspect of -green is _ I

important. Red, he claims, is too full of connota-
tion —' specifically the red-light district. And
blue, “Blue is almost too beautiful,” said Redl.
Green. Speaking in technology, it represents
the color of the earliest computer games ——- tiny,
pixilated green ﬁgures creating. a two-dimen-
sional world. Conceptually, Redl “consciously

refers to that world,” the world of our most basic.
"video-game technology. Unlike many technolog-

ically dependent artists, Redl refuses to let com-
puter capabilities take attention away from the
art. He respects the mechanical aspect of his

installations without sacrificing the retro sim-

plicity of his artistic message. .

Don’t catch the fever

Cabin Fever

Starring Rider Strong, Jordan
Ladd, James DeBeIIo, Joey
Kern, Cerina Vincent
Directed by Eli Roth

713: 1/2

Over the past week, ﬂiers declar-
ing “Peter Jackson, director of the
‘Lord of the Rings’ trilogy, is raving
 Brilliant! Fantastic!” have littered
the campus. The flier is referring to
the new gross—out horror flick “Cabin
Fever.” I don’t know what kind of
hobbit weed Mr. Jackson was smok-
ing at the time this statement was
made, but the film certainly falls
short of being either brilliant or fan-
tastic.

On the other hand, it is not sur-
prising that Jackson, would praise
such a film,. considering his earlier

~ works — “Dead Alive,” for example,

showcased a man pureeing zombies
with a lawnmower blade. In spite of
this, “Fever” seems too unnecessari-
ly disgusting, even for Jackson’s
taste.

“Cabin‘Fever” starts out with the
usual cast of young, stereotypical
horror—film characters: the slutty girl,
the nice girl, the asshole, the, guy
who’s still a virgin and the crude,
beer-swilling comic relief. While
staying in an out-of—the-way cabin, a
“crazy hermit” carrying a mysteri-
ous, flesh—eating virus infects trans-
mits the infection to their camp and,
unbeknownst to them, their water
supply. ‘Not only that, but — surprise
— he causes them to destroy their
only means of transportation.

Get up to speed

   

with what's mg
on. Check out online listings at

Stranded, the campers begin pro-
jectile vomiting copious amounts of
blood onto one another, rapidly
spreading the virus. One by one, the
campers either rot to death or get
eaten by a rabid dog while in the
process of doing so. But by this
point, the characters have proven

themselves to be so obnoxious that ‘

one can relish the sight of them hem-
orrhaging into oblivion.

Eli Roth, the first time
writer/director behind this gem, has
previous involvement with violent,
bloody films. Before becoming a
director, he worked for Troma, a New
York-based production company
known for outrageous, low—budget
films, including the cult classic “The
Toxic Avenger.” The influence
Troma had over Roth is obvious.

“Fever” is brimming with sex,
dismemberment, maiming and blood-
shed, all of which are done with a
sick, comic twist, reminiscent of
Troma. Roth also relies more on
shock value than on plot or dialogue,
another of Troma’s methods that he
unfortunately chooses to use. I

In hindsight, however, “Fever”
does manage to maintain some mor-
bid charm. The last half hourof the
film suddenly turns into an insane
whirlwind of hilarity, making up for
the first hour of gory boredom.
Perhaps if Roth had written the entire
film this way, he could have made it
worth the eight dollars spent to see it
in the theater. For this reason, those
who are still curious should definite-
ly wait for the video release.

However, he normally chooses not to include music

In this metaphorical sense, the “emotional neu-

the work is developed from a certain conceptual
basis, it is, like all memorable artwork, deeply per-

Panthers start six—game road trip with two losses

JIM ‘ EIBEN
For The Pitt News

The Pitt women’s soccer team began a string of

V six consecutive road games last weekend in disap-
pointing‘ style, coming up on the short end of two

..shutouts. The Panthers fell to Lehigh, 2-0, on

Friday night and lost on Sunday to St. Francis, 1-

O. i
The losses dropped Pitt’s record to 2-3 on the

season and left head coach Sue—Moy Chin’s expec-

tations unfulfilled.
“We looked ﬂat all weekend,” Chin said. “[The

coaches] were disappointed from the effort.”

Lehigh 2, Pitt 0 ' _
Pitt went into Bethlehem, Pa., on Friday with a
‘two-game winning streak, during which they had
averaged four goals per contest. ’ ~
Offense would prove to be hard to come by

against the Mountain Hawks, however. Lehigh _

played stellar defense, holding the Panthers to just
‘three shots. ' 7 _

tion we.’ve had so far,” Lehigh coach Manny Oudin

Midfielder Gina Lewandowski put the

Mountain_Hawks on the board early, scoring” in the _\

fourth minute. .\

_ The Panthers were unable to clear a bouncing
ball away from their own net, giving Lewandowski
the opportunity to crash in and chip the ball into
the left corner. V
The game tightened after theearly goal, and

Lehigh took a 1-0 lead into halftime.

The Mountain Hawks didn’t waste much time
in the second half, however, as Lewandowski
added her second goal of the game in the 53rd
minute. Lewandowski received a pass and blasted
it past Pitt goalkeeper Jamie Pelusi from 25—yards
out. ~

Pitt created more opportunities on _Sunday
afternoon against St. Francis, registering 10 shots.
However, none of the shots found their way past
Red Flash goalies Kelly Boyle and Melanie
Stockman — the Panthers continued their goal-
scoring drought. ‘ - ,

Thelone goal of the game came in‘ the 31st
minute, when St. Francis’ Cassie Taylor scored off
of a corner kick from two yards out.

Bright spots for the Panthers were Pelusi, who
was once again solid in net, and back Jacqueline
Reuter, whom Chin said played well in both ‘games
over the weekend. ‘ -

when they visit St. John’s in a Big East conference

Watch out, Steelers, there’s a newtop dog in town

It’s been a long

‘Not quite.

would even think
of uttering this
phrase, but the
Steelers are no
longer the best
football team in
Pittsburgh.

With no cable
or access to the Internet in my new
apartment, I’ve been reduced to lis-
tening to sporting events on the
radio. While it has done wonders for
my imagination, I would have to

~ guess that the Steelers looked just as

bad on television on Sunday as they
did in my head.

In the 12 seasons that Bill
Cowher has been head coach, the
running game has been a staple.in the
Steelers offense. With that said, it
has been safe to assume that, when-
ever a Pittsburgh quarterback throws
for over 300 yards, the Steelers
would win, because they probably
would have rushed for over l00
yards, as well.

So when Tommy Maddox threw
for 336 yards on ‘Sunday against the
Chiefs and Pittsburgh’s offense out-
gained Kansas City by almost a hun-
dred yards, you would think the
Steelers would win, right?

1,: '

IEATE BECKINSALE I

 

ground game nets
only 60 yards rush-
ing, your quarter-
back throws three
interceptions —
two of which came
in Kansas City ter-
ritory — and your
usually solid run defense gives up
158 yards rushing, you aren’t going
to win too many games. ‘ ' .

Never mind the fact that the spe-
cial teams allowed Dante Hall to
gain 208 yards on punt and kickoff
returns — he returned one kickoff
100 yards for a score. Oh, those spe-
cial teams.

Surprisingly, there were some
positives that came from this deba-
cle.

Pittsburgh’s normally spongy
passing defense held Trent Green to
just 125 yards passing. Jeff Reed
kicked a 51-yard field goal.

What excitement. I think I’m
going to wet my pants.

I’m not really going to, but a loss
is a loss no matter what good comes
out of it;

-of 30.5 points, and both games were

against teams that the Panthers
should have beaten.

Despite a seemingly uninspired
first half against Ball State and a
defensive lapse on three of the
Cardinals drives, thePanthers have
looked like a sound team.

The offensive line, despite hav-
ing two new starters and injuries to
centers -Justin Belarski and‘ Rob
Frederick, has performed well
enough that the running game is well
ahead of where it was last season.

‘ Against Kent State, halfback

Brandon Miree rushed for 113 yards,
and as a team, Pitt ran for 202 yards
and averaged 4.5 yards per carry.
Although he only gained 73 yards on
the ground, Miree scored a career-
high three rushing touchdowns last
week against Ball State. Last year at
this time, Miree wasn’t even a starter.

Probably the most enticing statis-
tics so far this season have been
those of quarterback Rod Rutherford.

Yeah, he hasn’t faced any diffi-
cult‘ defenses this season, but it’s
hard to ignore his numbers for the
year.

Rutherford has thrown for seven

touchdowns, competed 64.3 percent

of his passes and leads the nation in
passer efficiency with a rating of
191.5. Also, Rutherford is among the
top five candidates for the Heisman
Trophy, according to CNN/SI’s Luke
Wilson.

That might be a stretch, especial-
ly considering Pitt has yet to enter
the difficult part of its schedule. But
compared to where Rutherford,
Miree and the rest of the Panthers
were last year, there could be plenty
of good things ahead.

Joe Marchilena is the sports editor
for The Pitt News and feels that he
has fallen off from the high standards
that he set last year. What a slacker.
