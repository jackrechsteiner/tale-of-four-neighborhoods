Trading spaces in
Union stems from
space allocations  

ADAM FLEMING
Staff Writer

The ongoing process of space allocation ‘in
the William Pitt Union moved one step closer to
completion this month, as the building manager,
Christine Chergi, heard the last of the official

appeals from student groups.

Vice Provost for Undergraduate Studies and
Dean of Students Jack Daniel appointed Chergi
as the immediate interface for student groups
voicing complaints about the proposed redistrib-

ution of office space.

Chergi conferred with Associate Dean of

l /

Student Affairs Birney
Harrigan to resolve all
appeals. Harrigan and

administrators created unnecessary confusion
and delays in the procedure.

Yuengling’s heady environ-
mental controversy has finally
been settled.

The Pennsylvania brewery
agreed to pay a $110,000 penalty,
a fine imposed on it by the
Environmental Protection
Agency, for violating industrial
discharge limits set by the Clean
Water Act.

Under the

significant
industrial users of publicly owned
treatment facilities are required to
limit their pollution discharge.
, This precaution was designed to

ElCt,

protect the

capacity.
But "America’s Oldest

Brewery" did not do that, instead

plants’ treatment

discharging wastewater with
excess levels of copper, lead,
nickel and zinc.

The wastewater violated the
limits imposed by the brewery’s
mandatory pretreatment permit
and, according to the EPA, threat-
ened the efficiency of the
Pottsville municipal wastewater
treatment plant, which sends its
water to the Schuylkill River.

Specifically, Yuengling was
cited for 64 such violations in the
EPA’s complaint.

Yuengling received an addi-
tional citation froin the city of
Pottsville for 20 violations,
according to a press release from
the agency.

The fine was amended from
the EPA’s earlier request of a
$137,500 penalty.

appealed the University’s order that the radio sta-
tion vacate Room 416. in the Union.

Daniel defended the time it took his fellow
executives.

Some students use the Internet for
textbooks savings, in spite of risks

-NICK KEPPLER
B  Staff Writer

In light of_the recent tuition

-hike, students are looking for ways

to cut down the cost of education
more than ever.’ An increasingly
common tactic involves logging
onto Web sites, like Half.com and

eAmazon.com, in search of a better

deal on textbooks than campus
bookstores can offer. .

“It is so much cheaper,” Pitt
senior Ricky Wilson said about
online book buying. “I found a copy
of ‘Russian Folk Belief,’ by Linda
Ivanits, for $7 on Amazon.” '

The same book at the University
Book Center costs $24.95 for a new

’ copy and $18.95 for a used edition.

Junior Emily Long has shopped
for textbooks online since her fresh-

man year. ..
“I have a system,” she said. “I
make a chart with the price at the

,Book Center and the best price

online, and go with whoever is
cheaper.”

She estimated that her system
saves her about $100 each semester.

The Book Center has felt a
change. John Burns, the store’s text-
book manager, said he has noticed a
significant drop in sales since the
rise of online book buying. _

The appeal of shopping for texts
online is. not difficult to understand:
no.seemingly endless lines in which
to stand, no hulking box of text-
books to lug home and, best of all, a
potentially smaller bi1l.to foot.

‘. “You can’t expect someone to
respond to an appeal in one day,” he
said.

According to Rowland, Room
416 is crucial to the operation of
WPTS. - »

“If we lose that room, the radio
station is going to take a major step
back,” she said. “This is a vital
room for media, and we don’t
believe there’s any reason for a non-

media outlet to come to the fourth 

floor and breach what we have

going here.” ,
Rowland said that
the radio station

already willingly gave
up space to UPTV,
and added that Room
416 is a shared media
source, accessed by
WPTS, UPTV and’
The Pitt News.

Harrigan said that
she and Chergi had
not yet made" a final
decision concerning
the room.

Daniel added that,
regardless of the
result, in the case of
WPTS and in general,
some student groups
would be upset.

“I can’t satisfy 100 percent of
people,” Daniel said, pointing out
other groups that he said he visited
and received positive responses
from, such as the ‘Black Action
Society, Rainbow Alliance, Campus
Women’s Organization, UPTV and
Freedom Mentoring and Leadership
Development Honor Society.

Audrey Woosnam, the president
of Phi Eta Sigma, said that her orga-
nization faced no other problems
than those related to the physical act
of moving and was not upset with
its relocated space. V A

“If we lose
that room, the
radio station
is going to
take a major
step back.”

Allison Rowland
WPTS Station Manager

with space decisions

Todd Ridley, the president of the
College of General Studies Student
Government, . described the process
as diplomatic and complex.

“They have plans they have to
handle as an administration,” Ridley

said. “You have to give, and you

receive.”

But some groups said they were
asked to give too much.

The Panther Amateur Radio
Club -lost all of its office spacein
the Union and resorted ‘to working
with the School of Engineering to

find, a ‘new base of? operations,
according to the club’s president,

Ben Bertz.
Daniel said
that the process’

would move forward
once all appeals were
heard and decisions
were finalized.

“This is just a
beginning of what I
intend to do,” Daniel
said. “We need better
space for the
[ S t u d e n t
Organization
Resource Center].”

Daniel also

‘said that he wanted
to convert the Union
into a better operat-
ing, fully functional
student center.

Part of his plan to do so
involved asking Harrigan to visit
the University of Virginia and
observe its student center. 4

Harrigan said that after visiting
the school, she must first charge a
committee at Pitt to formulate rec-
ommendations. A

The committee would then gath-

. er student input.

Although Harrigan said she
knows who will be on the commit-
tee, she would. not yet officially
announce the appointees.

Students have many options

Books, page 1 V "

College Stores reported that the
average retail price of a new text-
book is $68.00. Half.com, one of the
most popular sites for buying used
texts, claimed that the average price
of a textbook on their site is $
17.34. .

"Dave Feller, Half.com’srdire’ctor
of marketing, said Half.com users
save an average of 60 percent on
textbooks. ' I

But Half.com is hardly the only
option for online textbook shop-
ping. Amazon.com, Walmart.com
and Barnesandnoblecom all feature
sections for purchasing textbooks.
There ‘are also many smaller sites

dedicated solely to textbooks,
including “eCampus.com,
Textbookx.com and

Swapbooks.com. I 

Students not only have a pletho-

Ira of options for to buy books, but

also how to buy them, as well.
Half.com, Amazon.com and
Textbookx.com connect buyers with
sellers and act only as an intermedi-
ary in the transfer of funds.
eCampus.com

and used textbooks directly.
Amazon.com and Walmart.com sell
new textbooks, often atdiscounted
prices. A -

But if you are waiting for the
catch, wait no longer. Students

‘should be aware‘ of a number of

problems that may arise when buy-
ing books online.

Students might accidentally pur-
chase the ‘wrong book. There are a
number of different textbooks. with
a generic name like “Chemistry” or
“Psychology.”

There are also often several edi-
tions of a title. .

Feller said the best way to
search Half.comvis to use an ISBN
— a 10-digit identification number
that marks any book unmistakably.
Most books feature the ISBN above
or below the bar code. —

But Burns, defending the book-
store method of book buying, point-
ed out a complication involving
ISBNs and said they could be mis-
leading. ,

Consider the Calculus 101 pack-
age as an example. The package
includes a text, two homework man-
uals and a compact disc. The entire
package’ has an ISBN, but so does

" _ each individual piece. I ‘

“A person will type in the ISBN
for the main book, see the picture,
and think ‘Oh, ’that’s my book; I’ll
buy it’ — but they won’t get the
discs, or manuals,” Burns said. “A
lot of homework will depend on the

A and"
Barnesandnoble.com sell both new

disc or manuals.”

Burns also pointed out that,
most often, the packaged sets are
used for the biggest classes.

Feller, coming from the online

side of book buying, said buyer-

seller communication is essential to
ensure that the seller has exactly
what the buyer needs. '

Another problem arises when

buyers must trust the seller’s word
that textbooks will be sent promptly
—— or at all. Feller said dishonest
sellers are “very, very, very uncom-
mon”. on Half.com. He added that,
before buying, users can view a sell-

er’s feedback profile, which lists

comments from others who have
bought from the seller. Amazon.com
and Swapbooks.com feature similar
systems. 5

According to Feller, late ship-
ments are rare.

But, returns are also difficult
online. It is up to the seller’s discre-
tion if the return will be accepted,
regardless of the reason.

Students should also know that,
sometimes, the best deal may actu-
ally be at Pitt’s Book Center. A ran-
dom sampling of five textbooks
found that the average difference
between the Book Center’s‘ price for
a new copy and thebest price online
was $28.77, in favor of books
online. . The average difference
between the price for aused copy
and the best price online, however,
was $6.59 — only a small difference
after a shipping and handling fee is
added. -

“The Textbook V of Medical
Physiology,” by Guyton and‘ Hall,
cost" $56.25 at the Book Center.
Neither Amazon.com nor Half.com
could beat that price.

Oakland’s independent textbook
stores present a third option. Marcy
McAninch, manager of Got Used
Bookstore at 3601 Forbes Ave., said
the store tries to undercut the Book
Center. ‘

the top,50 titles, and the feedback is
that we are usually lower,”
McAninch said. .

The same random sampling
showed Got Used’s price to often be
$2 or $3 cheaper than the Book
Center —— a small sum, but perhaps
worth a walk down Forbes.

All things considered, Burns is
sure the Book Center is the smartest
place for students to shop. Only
they can make a guarantee, he said.

“[The online stores] do not get a
phone call from anyone if they sell
the wrong book,” Burns explained.
“No math professor is going to call
them and say, ‘Why did you sell my
students the wrong package?”’ T S

Dancing leads to fun — and far worse

In a nod to the nation’s Puritan
history, Allentown, Pa., has been
enforcing a 1931 ban on dancing after
1 a.m. Active enforcement began after
August 17, when, according to Mayor
Roy C. Afflerbach, fights had escalat-
ed into near-riots. Weapons, drugs and
alcohol have been confiscated outside
dance clubs.

The city’s two dance clubs — not
bars —— stay open until 5 a.m., but
apparently, revelers are expected to sit
around discussing philosophy at 3
a.m. on Saturdays.

Clearly, cutting a rug is the cause
of all of Allento_wn’s woes. Everyone
knows that dancing is the devil’s
handiwork, and leads to all sorts of
naughtiness. Who knows, it could
even lead to fraternization between
the sexes. And what’s next?
Unauthorized grinning? Laughing out
of turn? The ramifications are terrify-
mg.

What about some. drastic changes
to the laws? Instead of outlawing
dancing, outlaw fighting. Outlaw
drugs. Make it a crime to have open
alcohol containers. Oh, wait...

One has to wonder if there is a
spectrum of illegality. For instance,
does doing the Macarena warrant
deportation? Anyone caught doing the
Electric Slide should probably get the
electric chair. And the Achy Breaky?
Violators should be shot on sight.

What about the horizontal bop?

And who determines what, exact-
ly, counts as dancing? One man’s
limping lurch is another man’s busted
move. Do horrible dancers get .a pass
because no one but them thinks they
are “dancing?”

What about car—dancing? You
know, the seated rhythmic wriggle
when a good tune comes on the radio.
Is that just a misdemeanor? There

‘ aren’t any feet involved, after all.

Instead of outlawing dancing, out-

-law the causes of dancing. Make pos-

session of feet a felony. Junk all the
jukeboxes. Put the hammer down on
humming. ,

Chasing down errant boogiers is
clearly the best way to utilize the
police force. It’s not as if Allentown is
always among the state’s top cities for
per—capita murders. And imagine how

great an officer must feel after break— _

ing up a dance-ring. The rush of a
career in law enforcement must really
be great after that happens.

Before dancing becomes a nation-
al epidemic, federal lawmakers should
follow Allentown’s stellar example.
_We clearly need to outlaw all dancing
in the country. Then, the economy will
improve, there’ll be jobs aplenty, and
there will be no anti—American senti-
ment abroad.

But heaven forbid we celebrate by
dancin’ in the streets.

Perpetually single? Blamethe city

In 2001, we were second to last. By
2002; we dropped to last. 2003? Dead last
again. Over. the summer, Forbes Magazine
readers voted Pittsburgh the worst

American city for singles. *

Give or take a few months, I’ve spent
the majority of my 20-year life single with
no complaints. But one day, I’ll want to
change my unpronounceable last name.
Although I’ in attending Pitt to get an edu-
cation, I also hoped this four-year invest-
ment would result in a potential signiﬁcant
other. . ,

But apparently, Pittsburgh may not
help make the dream a-reality.

One of Pitt’s greatest
qualities is the wide variety of
opportunities it offers its stu-
dents. If you want to spend a
semester aboard a cruise liner,
Pitt makes it happen.
Interested in Arabic? Scuba
diving? Collegiate ultimate
Frisbee? Pitt takes care ‘of
you. They should do the same
for the decision to remain sin-
gle or not.

Perhaps it isn’t Pitt’s
fault, but that doesn’t exempt '
it from remedying the situation. If '
Pittsburgh was rated the most unsafe city

Maria Wrzosek
Columnist

in ,America, I have no doubt Pitt _would 0

make sure its students were protected
while on campus. Why not approach the
dire singles situation the same way? Pitt
cannot leave its single students helpless.

V How else are we to marry in Heinz Chapel

and generate offspring that will attend Pitt?
The future of our children, Pitto and
Pittina, depends on addressing the strug-
gles of Pittsburgh singles. ‘
According to Forbes.com, one of the
reasons’ for Pittsburgh’s low rating is the
lack of single people. Pitt’s admissions
office can tackle that problem. Why not
insert check boxes with “single” or “not
single” on applications? If a potential stu-
dent marks the “single” box, an extra 200

 

points should be added to his or her SAT
score. A

The next step in improving Pitt’s sin-
gles scenario involves Residence Life.
Social psychology tells us proximity is a
dominant force of attraction. Instead of

_organizing dorm residents by grade ‘or
major, availability should be the main .

room—assignment factor. Doors should not
only post residentsfnames, but also zodiac

signs, favorite movies and what they ﬁnd I

most attractive in a partner. If a resident
becomes un-single and wants to remain in
the singles dorm or ﬂoor, he or she must
assist another student’s quest
for attachment. . "
. Room for improvement
' also exists outside of the resi-

‘ dence halls. Stores ‘don’t
make customers guess if
something is on sale. There
are classified’ ads and “For
Sale” signs that allow con-
sumers to know What mer-
chandise is obtainable. Single
students should follow that
examplexand wear emblems
advertising their availability.
In class,,professors are in the

position to help a single guy or gal out by
assembling group project "members
according to their single or non-single sta-
tus. We give professors our Social Security
numbers; why not disclose our availability
category?

Above all, to keep students from
resorting to online dating services, Pitt
needs to establish mind-reading classes.
Regardless of how many telepathic mes-
sages I send to the cute guy sitting next to
me in the I-Iillman Library, oddly enough,
he never responds with a marriage or Dave
& Andy’s proposal. A
Maria is glad she can now blame
Pittsburgh, not her own social incompe-
tence, for her perpetual single status.

Dedicated drinkers can’t be stopped by mere liquor laws

West Virginians are far more enlightened than
Pennsylvanians. Obviously, we are not referring to
their breeding practices or dental hygiene,‘ but there is
one area in which the superiority of our Southern
neighbors is evident. Sure, we all know that West
Virginians are slack-jawed yokels who enjoy the
company of sheep and relatives— -
once—removed, but those crazy back-
woods hicks have us beat when it
comes to good ol"fashioned liquor
laws. .

As all us budding alcoholics
know, Pennsylvania’s liquor laws are
tyrannical; nay, Draconian. /State-
owned liquor stores, the lack of beer
in grocery stores, and the stunning
disregard for the Sunday drinker all
conspire to drive _a man to drink —

American ingenuity took over.
Using only those commodities that they could
“borrow” or procure cheaply, our brave heroes set up
an “illegal liquor-making operation,” or, in layman’s
terms, _a still. Lothrop Hall trashcans
proved useful for holding the water,

some conveniently stolen chemistry

The coalition of impromptu home

of the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board.
Inroads were made via the wonderful World Wide

"Web, where a similar splinter cell of drinkers was

found on an exotic island half a world away, where
the beer ﬂows like boxed wine and the women are
buxom and subservient. These like—rninded doctors of
distillation could, for a pittance, provide a large quan-
tity of the world’s most wonderful little creature:
yeast. After a few weeks, during which the brave
rebels were forced to drink fermented Clamato juice,
the miraculous microorganisms arrived. This is the

drank it, but it was all worth it. At the end of the week,
22 glistening liters of disgusting, yeasty, cheap, and
delicious’ alcohol sat fermenting in a brown plastic

garbage can.

After skimming out the yeast carcasses, the brew-

ers set to distilling. Using a forbidden hot plate, pil-

fered Erlenmeyer ﬂasks, aquarium tubing, and elbow
grease, the 22 liters of 20 percent alcohol were slow-
ly and painstakingly puriﬁed to several liters of blind-
ingly strong hooch. The final step was to improve the

Now it only remained to test the beverage of

experimented upon were themselves and a few choice

internal hemorrhaging, bootleg Bloody Marys were
deemed disgusting, and even the venerable screw-
driver was unappetizing. Finally, a bizarre mix of
Starbucks raspberry syrup, OJ and the moonshine -
later named the Rising Sun — was concocted. The
revolution was a success.

The shackles of the LCB having been cast off, the
discovery was announced to the world. Setting new
records for Lothrop Hall single dorm room occupan-

the Boston Tea Party or the Million Man March, a
group of oppressed citizemy had stood up against
“The Man.”

Life, liberty, and the pursuit of drunkenness had
been preserved, and the balance of the world was
restored. .

I was forced to get a cell phone.
Yes, that’s right. I just got a cell
phone, midway through the summer.
My dad laid down the law at the end
of June, ‘after I had gotten stuck at
the airport, or missed dinner, or bor-
rowed‘ his car without him being
able to get in touch with me, just one
too many times for him to handle.

He’d never admit this, however.
His parental justification for forcing
me to make such a purchase is,
“Living off campus is going to make
it harder, to get in touch.” I’m mot

sure I totally understand his logic,
' But by this point in my life, I know

it’s better not toargue with the man.

At first, ‘*the cell” seemed like it
could be a sweet deal —— since Dad
was forcing the issue, I assumed
he’d be willing to fund this little
communication expenditure.

Wrong. _

I am now the not—so—proud
owner of a little, black phone
equipped with the cheapest plan
AT&T has to offer, with the ‘luxury
of free nights and weekends.

Owning a cell phone in itself
isn’t that big of an issue. I admit, it’s

to deal with riﬂing through the seats
of my car, trying to find 35 cents to
use a pay phone. I don’t

‘think anyone on the plan-

that they hiked pay phone
fares up 10 cents.

The fact is, I am now
just like everybody else. I

Now, let’s focus on
the ring tone. Cell
phones have to be the
most annoying-sounding things in
the entire world. My roommate last
year had a ring that I would rather
stick pencils‘ through my eyes than
listen to. She happens to be, like, the
most popular chick in the world, too,
because that sucker just rings and

rings, 24/7. I came really close to

throwing it out the window a few
times. '
Currently, my phone is set on
Madonna’s “Holiday.” It’s a boppy
little tune that is sure to annoy the
hell out of people around me.

Sure enough, I forgot to turn it
off one morning, and for whatever
reason, my mother decided to call
me. For the life of me, I can’t figure
out why— she knows I never even
answer the thing until after 9 p.m.,
when it’s free. .

Anyhoo, I’m sitting in class, and
suddenly, “Holiday”~is booming

me — I’m forever going to be
remembered as “that girl” with the
annoying cell phone.

Congas, timbales, trumpets and
the piano are just a few Latin band
instruments that provoke us to move
in such sensual ways. When played,
these instruments, manipulated by
musicians from Cuba, Puerto Rico
and elsewhere in. the Caribbean,
come to life. It’s nearly impossible to
stand still while listening; hearing
the music turns into a transformative
experience, allowing the listener to
escape and let free—ﬂowing moves
take over his or her body —— that is, if
the moves of the salsa dance andthe
rhythmic motions are known.

Surely, various brassy voices
have resonated through your radio
station at one time or another. Maybe
it was one of the many tributes to
Celia Cruz, who shook up the world
and added Tumbao to life, creating
an interest to learn about salsa. This
past February, Ibrahim Ferrer, of
Buena Vista Social Club fame, came
to Pittsburgh, and those who attend-
ed the performance would likely
agree that it was one of the best con-
certs played here. Not a single per-
son sat in the seats of the Benedum.
Instead, they stood, clapping, sway-
ing and cheering for him and his
band.

However, along with these Latin
rhythms come movements that are

While standing, in the audience, I
saw some rather pitiful dance moves
from inexperienced fans. I was
amazed to see people jumping up and
down as if they were at a Kid Rock
concert. Then there were the famous
swayers —- those lacking creativity. I
was waiting‘ for lighters to go up in
the air, flickering and ﬂashing to
heal the world and make, it a better
place. Luckily, the concert was short
and absolutely sweet.

Tonight, you all get a chance to
learn to dance in true salsa tradition.

Brought to Pitt undergraduate stu-

dents by the Pitt Program Council,
the Arthur Murray Dance Studio will
instruct participants how to move to
Latin rhythms. This event intends to
add a little salsa to your less-than-
spicy lives. If we listen to this music
filled with passion and a historical
legacy, we better at least learn how
to move to it.

International Week at Pitt is com-
ing soon. You needn’t go far to soak up
some culture from the myriad of lec-
tures, concerts, exhibits, contests,
films and activities offered from Sept.
27 through Oct. 4.

The Office of International
Services and the University Center for
International Studies, organizers of the
annual event, promise some new activ-
ities this year, including a sidewalk
chalk mural competition on Saturday.

Epicureans ‘can register for special.

events such as the Oakland restaurant
tour or the Persian cooking demonstra-
tion. The Mongolian barbecue, inter-
national beer tasting, and East

European dinner and dance perfor-
mance all sound tempting. And it’s
easy to work all that eating off with the
rich variety of dance and sporting
events, including salsa lessons,
Scottish games, and a soccer tourna-
ment.

International week also offers
opportunities to gain information
about studying or working abroad and,
of course, to gain perspective on glob-
al . issues with panel discussions
throughout the week. ’

Man of 1,000 bands talks

DAWN DIEHL
Staff Writer

Mike “Man of 1,000 Bands”
Shanley, A&E Editor at Pulp, not to
mention a vocalist and bass player,
opens up with this intrepid reporter
about writing music, writing about
music and performing live with The
Mofones. -

Have you always been artistic?

I’ve wanted to play music from the
time I was seven years old and
heard Alice Cooper for the very first
time. I wanted to tour with Alice
Cooper. I always wanted to play in a
band. I had this idea that I was
going to be a music major because I
played the saxophone. I applied to a
couple music schools, including
Duquesne, where I had. one of the

textbook horrible auditions. I was

totally demoralized but I couldn’t
bring myself ‘to realize: “try some-
thing else.” The Berklee School of
Music; I got into them just on the
basis of the written applications.

But you didn’t enter B_erklee.

I went to Duquesne for five minutes
when I was 18 — one semester,
really — and then goofed off for a
few years and enrolled at Pitt when-
I was 21. I was still thinking,r“Well,
I’ll be a‘ music major.” By that time,
I knew that if I had 12 hours a day
to devote to playingsaxophone, I
might be pretty good. But I didn’t,

 

and by then, I was a much better
bass player because I played twice a
week at practice with a band. I used
to be in a band called Bone of
Contention years ago,_
thought, “Well, I’ll just be a writing
major.” I can still remember sitting
in Algebra class thinking that. I was
like, “Whoa! That’s what I’ll do.

Yeah! You can’t make money from.

playing music anyway, and you can
from writing, and I like writing.”

Do you have any regretswaitingi

to go back to school?

I think I had a better perspective on
things. I was hanging around Pitt all
the time ‘cause all these people that
I knew worked‘ for the radio station
and I wanted to work for the radio
station and I wanted to go to classes

and talk about the same stuff they

did. ‘Cause I was just like the guy
who just came around and hung out.
You know — this crazy, beatnik
roommate. ' _ ~

Tell _me about being the Arts and
Entertainment editor at Pulp.
What do you like about it?

I’Ve always loved music, and it’s
great writing about it and hearing
stuff and talking to musicians. I

never want to think about things

this way, about how I did a goodjob
or I really connect,with musicians,
but there have been times I’ve
talked to people where I feel like

‘97 Three Rivers Film Festival opener opens again

The Journey

Starring Roshan Seth, Saeed
Jaffrey, Antony Zaki and Carrie
Preston

Directed by Harish Saluja
‘7fx"7i‘r’t‘r

A. HORBAL
Staff Writer

If you have any interest at all in
the Pittsburgh film scene, you stand
to profit greatly by seeing “The
Journey.”

The directorial debut of
Pittsburgh resident Harish Saluja,
“The Journey” opened the 1997
Three Rivers Film Festival and
returns to Pittsburgh Filmmakers’
Regent Square Theater for a one-
week engagement through Thursday.

Roshan Seth, who you might
have seen in “Gandhi” or “Raiders
of the Lost Ark,” stars as Kishan
Singh, a retired Indian schoolmas-
ter, come to visit his son Raj
(Antony Zaki), a Pittsburgh doctor.
Almost immediately, conﬂict devel-
ops between Kishan and Laura

.(Carrie Preston), Raj’s American

wife. As the two learn to live togeth-

er, they learn a great deal about each_

other’s worlds. As do we, because
Saluja affords us an opportunity not
only to learn about Indian culture
but also to view our own from the
outside.

The film has often been com-

‘ pared to early Ang Lee and late

Satyajit Ray —— after whom Saluja’s
production company, New Ray
Films, is named — and for good rea-
son. While there is nothing especial-
ly unique about the film’s basic
“fish out of water” premise, the sub-
tle, sensitive treatment of both the
story and the characters is refresh-
ing. The conﬂict, for instance, rests
not on the ways that Kishan and
Laura fail to get. along but rather on

the ways that they -gradually suc-. :

ceed. The result is a touching, posi-
tive film.

What makes “The Journey” of
particular local interest is the way in
which cinematographer John Rice
has shot the city of Pittsburgh.
Landmarks such as Fallingwater are
integrated into the plot, but without
seeming contrived. Likewise, strik-
ing locations and beautiful, linger-
ing long shots make even Oakland
look like an appealing place to live.

This is all done without exploiting ,

or selling Pittsburgh as a location -
not one of these shots feels extrane-
ous. ' .

There is a rather alarming local
tendency, particularly here at Pitt, to
celebrate any film with a Pittsburgh
connection,_regardless of how tenu-
ous the connection or how terrible
the film.' “The Journey” is a good
film, set in Pittsburgh, made by a
local director and an almost entirely
local cast. This is the kind of film-

making we want to cultivate.
Lamentably, relatively few peo-
ple have seen it. Hopefully, after

this latest engagement, that condi-'

tion will be somewhat alleviated and
“The Journey” can enter the dia-
logue about the future of film in
Pittsburgh, which is

where it -'
belongs. I won’t cry if we have to:‘

forget about “Dumb and Dumber” to
make space in the conversation.

“The Journey” opened on Friday at
Pittsburgh Filmmakers’ Regent

tSquare Theater and runs through

Thursday, October 2. Go to

COURTESY Pl'I'I‘SBURGH FILMMAKERS

Writer, bassist, lyricist: ls thereanything this man can’t do?

Shanley, page 6

there has been a bond there. There was a jazz
musician, Charlie Haden, a bass player who
came to town earlier this year. He started out
playing avant-garde jazz in the ‘50s. His work
deals with human rights and struggling to over-
come prejudice; things like that. He said some-
thing that struck me as kind of deep in the mid-
dle of the conversation. Something like, “I
always want. to tell audiences that you’re a real-
ly great audience and I wish I could multiply you
three thousand times and the world would be a
better place.” I didn’t know how to respond to it,
and I always hate having dead air. I just said,
“Wow, man, you gave me something really —
you’ve given me a lot to think about.” And he
said, “That’s cool man! That’s great — I’m
glad!” It felt genuine and like, he doesn’t always
get that kind of a response from interviewers.

The song “Failed Attempts at a New
Testament” from Mofones! The CD that you
and The Mofones recorded last year — I think
a lot of artists can relate to having doubts
about their art.

Yeah, that’s really what it’s about. I think every
few years, I write a song about writing songs, but

a few years ago in The New York Times, they had
a round-up of all the boxed sets that came out
that year. They had the Guided by Voices boxed
set, and, you know, Robert Pollard is the guy
who is kind of the leader of the band. The guy
writing about the boxed set said something to the
effect of, “any time Robert Pollard sneezes, a
good song comes out.” And I was thinking, “I
wish I could really do that, just come up with a
song.” So from putting down the newspaper,
going upstairs and getting ready to take a show-
er, I had this chorus in my head, and an idea for
the song, and I kind of built it around that. It is
hard writing a song. It’svreally like pulling teeth
for me. ‘

Why do you think it’s hard?

I doubt myself all the time. I’m always really
insecure about my melody lines, you know,
“Does it sound like the last song I wrote?”
Sometimes I’ll sit down and come up with a song
idea and get the structure down and a melody and
a few lines, and I’ll think, “Well, that’s good for
now. I’ll come back to it.”

Who has inﬂuenced you a lot with bass?
Mike Watt, who was in The Minutemen and then
fIREHOSE. The Minutemen were a punk rock

band out in California in the ‘80s. They didn’t
sound like a typical punkrband — there, were jazz
influences and funk, and he’d just play all ov-er
the bass. I remember seeing them when I was in
high school. I was just learning to play the bass
and my way was like hitting the low E string, just
playing an open note and moving up like this. I
swear, for the first half of the set, he didn’t even
touch the E string. He was just allover the other
ones, so I always thought, “Wow, I’d really like
to play like that.” ‘

You seem to have a lot of fun performing —
would you like to do more? ‘

Oh, I’d love to -do more. It’s hard the day after a
show coming down just because, I mean, it is
fun. It’s a blast. Playing in general is — you
know, I think if I did it more, it would make the
down "times even harder because it is kind of a
rush playing, especially if you have an apprecia-
tive audience. Anytime we can play, we’ll be
happy to do so. Anyw-here they’ll have us is
good.

Mike Shanley and the rest of The Mofonesi play
Thursday, Oct. 2 at 9:30 pm at the 31st Street
Pub,’ 3101 Penn Ave. in the Strip District. For

6 6 In a game that featured five goals
and multiple scoring chances, the
story, in the end, was defense.

Villanova Wildcats goalkeeper
Craig Bald made critical saves late in
the game to help his team defeat the
Panthers 3-2.

Bald’s most crucial save came

- with about nine minutes remaining in
the game. The play developed when”

the ball was kicked forward to
Panthers midfielder Tyler Bastianelli.
Bastianelli used his head to deﬂect
the ball across the goal box to Bryan
Headrick, who kicked the ball right
'into hands of a diving Bald.

“Their keeper made a great save,”
Coach Joe Luxbacher said. “I thought
it was in.”

Panthers midfielder ‘ Shawn
Wildman, who generally plays back
near the defensemen, made his way
to about five yards in front of Bald
and headed a ball just to the right of
the net. The near miss would have

The Wildcats (5-4-1 Overa1l,\l-3

first half. Forward Chris Blatz kicked
the ball from five yards out into a
Panthers defender. The ball deflected
and rolled right into the net. Panthers
goalkeeper Justin Lowery _was unable
to make the save because he was out
of position after reacting to the initial
shot.

The goal came at the 28:12 mark
with an assist by forward Marcelo
Rodriguez. _

A few minutes after‘Blatz’s goal,
he slashed between two Panthers and
nearly maneuvered the ball into the
net by himself, but Lowery came out
to steal the ball.

Dieffenbach said. ' ’
Youngstown State won two of three matches in
doubles play, giving them one point toward the
match score. ' . ’

I In the No. 1 doubles match, Karen Najbert and
Gina Peretti defeated Pitt.’s Annie Davies and
Hayley Hughes by a score of 8-4. .

In a closely contested match, Youngstown’s
No. 2 doubles team» of Nicole Muzechuk and
Heather Hagood was able to get by Becky Emmers
and Emily Hughes 8-6.’,

I

The Panthers’ Laura Pegula and Konita Jude
cruised through in No. 3 doubles, defeating Sarah
Evans and Andrea Dixon, 8-0. '

With. the match‘ score at 1-0 in favor of

Youngstown State, the singles play began with Pitt

coming out strong and resilient, needing four sin-
gles victories to win the team match. The Panthers
were evidently up to the challenge, coming

‘through with wins in the No. l‘,_No. 2, No. 5, and

No. 6 matches. ,
- Emmers dominated her entire match, and came
away with a 6-4, 6-1 win over Najbert in No. 1 sin-
gles. -
In the N o. 2 singles match, Davies won in deci-
sive fashion over Hagood in straight sets, 6-2, 6-2.
In the No. 3 spot, Hayley Hughes played an
extremely close match against Youngstown’s
Peretti. Hughes lost the firstset in a tiebreak, but
was able to come back in the second set and get a
late service break to force a match tiebreaker.
Hughes could not ride the momentum of her sec-

ond-set win and was defeated in the match‘
tiebreaker. Peretti took the match 7-6, 9-7, 5-7, 10-

4 in the longest match of the day.

Emily Hughes, in the No. 4 singles match, lost
, a tough match to Muzechuk by a score of 6-3 and

6-2.

Pitt’s No. 5 singles player Pegula proved the
better player in her match, rolling past Dixon, 6-2,
6-1.

Completing the action ‘for the day, in the No. 6
singles match, was Jude, who handled Evans the
entire match. Jude took the match 6-1 and 6-2 to
seal the deal for Pitt.

“It was great to win the match after being
down after doubles. Those four players fought
very hard to get the wins that they did,”
Dieffenbach said. “The team was able to stay
aggressive and work hard. to hold serve and get

some breaks of serve, which is what was needed to

win this match.”

This weekend, Pitt will travel to West Point,
N.Y., to participate in the Women’s Eastern
Collegiate Tournament, which features more than

30 teams from all over the East Coast and is slated.

to go from Oct. 3 to Oct. 5.

Tommy Maddox can leadSteelers to Super Bowl XXXVIII

In tribute to my favorite writer, ESPN.com’s
sports guy Bill Simmons, I amigoing to share my
sports—related ramblings with you. So here goes
nothing.

-Allen Iverson signed a four-year-contract—extension
for almost $80 million. What does this mean for
Philly fans?

Well, besides watching A.I. shoot 34 percent
from the field until 2009, it means their streak of

_ early playoff exits will continue. Is there somewhere

that I can bet the 76ers won’t win a championship
during Iverson’s tenure?

°Anytime poker is on ESPN or the Travel Channel,’

can you turn away? I know I can’t; maybe that’s just
the gambler in me. By the way, anyone want to lend
me 10 grand to enter the World Series of Poker? I
promise to pay it back after I win. '

-How many millionaires get convicted of underage
drinking?

Only in the National Basketball Association does
this happen. Portland Trailblazers forward Zach
Randolph, who just turned 21, was convicted of
underage drinking stemming from an incident last
May. ’

With the inﬂux of teenagers in the NBA, an
underage drinking arrest was bound to happen, but
Portland again?

The Trailblazers aren’t the best team in the NBA,
but. they do lead it in arrests. I wonder how soon the
next Trailblazer will go down. My money is on
Damon Stoudamire, who leads the Trailblazers in
off—field activity. Some of you out there who
received underage—drinking citations probably were
fined. Randolph was, too; his total ﬁne: one dollar.
-Speaking of fines, I think the parking police have it
in for me. I just received tickets nine and ten of the
year and it’s still September! Anyone else have this
problem? ‘

 

es

How am I supposed to keep track of which side of

the street is getting cleaned each day? I called 4-

FACT, and they told me to walk outside and check’

the sign. I am far too lazy for that. -

-Speaking of lazy, where exactly can I park’ when I
drive up to the Petersen Events Center to work out?

-For former high—school athletes, is there anything
better than intramural football? Sunday kicked off
the season, and I , am juiced for my squad’s
Wednesday night kickoff. I know Iiam not alone in
this, but isn’t the most important part your team
name? _

My team’sname shall not be mentioned, but
when you look at the schedule and see your opponent
has a dumb name, don’t you get real cocky and say,
“they can’t be good; their name is weak?”

-This just in: Trailblazers forward Rasheed Wallace
was ticketed for driving with a suspended license
and driving without insurance. How can an NBA
player not have insurance? Must be too hard to
afford after those one—dollar fines.

-After visiting Vegas for the first time this past
August, I have discovered a man can live on Red
Bull alone. Could this be the reason I lost money
there? _

Perhaps, but the most difficult transition in

school this year was trying to incorporate my Red
Bull diet. It’s a work in progress, but anyone know
where I can get a case of Red Bull for fewer than
$40? Maybe 4—FACT will tell me to "check the signs

“ '-tliege, too.

 I the only one who wishes “Family Guy” was

back on the air? This show is as underrated as Neil

”’O’Donnell was as a quarterback. Come on people, he

 -5;  us (by us I mean the Steelers, and yes,"I am on
’ ’,the team) to a Super Bowl. .

Both should be brought back, onelon Comedy

Central, and the other on ESPN Classic. If Classic ‘

has room for the United States Football League,

- _ there must be room for dear Neil.

°Hey, Pittsburgh, if O’Donnell can get to the Super
Bowl, why not Tommy Maddox? Don’t give me this
“he is not mobile and is easy tolhit” nonsense.'He is
an exact copy of O’Donnell. ‘

You never hear peoplesay, “Drew Bledsoe is not
that good; he is immobile.” Besides, Sunday’s loss to
Tennessee was an aberration. Once’ the offensive line
gets healthy — bas'ically,’when Marvel Smith returns
— the Steelers will be fine. ‘

-Eagles fans, I received all your online complaints
about Donovan McNabb. If only I. actually listened
to your arguments. The Eagles, despite their Sunday
victory, are not a good football team. Bottom line,
the Eagles have no offensive weapons.

Oh, and your one former weapon, just like me,"

was a much better player and athlete about 20
pounds ago. Considering the Eagles receivers disap-

peared, is it possible McNabb ate Todd Pinkston? Or

just ate too much Chunky Soup?

Matt Miloszewski is a sports writer for The Pitt News
and wishes he had a mailbag following like Bill
Simmons. He can be reached at mattmil050@hot-
mail.com . ‘ ’

ball bounced around and was finally
cleared out by the Wildcats.

The ball wasn’t cleared out for .

long; midfielder’ . Brian: ;Madden
moved the ball across the box. The
ball bounced off of midfielder Marco
Carrizales and then off of a Wildcats’
defender before midfielder Brendon
Smith ran in and kicked the ball past
Bald. The unassisted goal was scored
at the 49:18 mark.

The Wildcats struck baglgquickly.
Defender David O’Donnell moved to ,
ball to defender Colin Raws,* who
juked around a Panthers’ defender,
and shot the ball from five yardsout;
Lowery was only able to get the tips
of his fingers on theball, and it con-
tinued to the back of the ‘net. \

Less than two minutes later, the‘
Wildcats scored an insurance goal.
Midfielder Scott Rodemer kicked the

ball in play on a corner kick, and‘

O’Donnell was standing in theright
spot. The ball settled down in front of

him, and he shot it past Lowery to put '

the Wildcats up 3-1.

A ‘The Wildcats continued to pour
on the offense until midfielder Dan
Massimini shot a penalty kick well
above the cross bar. After the missed
penalty kick, Pitt started to gain
momentum. Madden moved the ball
down the right side of the field and
passed it to the middle’ where
Bastianelli one-timed the ball past
Bald. '

The goal came at 68:41, cutting
the Wildcats’ lead to 3-2. Madden
recorded the assist on the play.

The Panthers managed eight
shots in the game, seven of them
coming in the second half. Bald fin-
ished the game with two official
saves to record the win for the
Wildcats.

The Panthers’ next game is Oct. 1
against Niagara at 4 p.m.

The Villanova Wildcats scored three goals despite the efforts of Pitt defender Clay
Haﬂich, No. 18, shown in action earlier this year. The Panthers lost the game 3-2.
