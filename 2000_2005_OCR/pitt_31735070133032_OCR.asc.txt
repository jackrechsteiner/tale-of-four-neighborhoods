Plaza mayreplace parking lot

MICHELLE SCOTT
Senior Staff Writer

Several organizations throughout
Pittsburgh are giving up the green to
get Oakland some more green.

Green space, that is.

Schenley Plaza, the space between
the Carnegie Museums and Library
and Hillman Library, used to be a park
that opened into the larger Schenley

«Park, but over time, it evolved into the

parking lot Pitt students know today. 0
C Now, several organizations work-
ing on the “Schenley Plaza Project,”
including Pitt, CMU, and the ‘City of
Pittsburgh, are trying to turn the plaza
back into a public park '
At a public meeting on Sept 30,

representatives of I the Schenley Plaza ‘
p A Project presented the schematic design,

which was created by Sasaki
Associates, an urban design and land-
scape architecture
According toAl_istair Mclntosh, a prin-
cipal at Sasaki, the new space will

‘include a large open lawn, several
  smaller gardens and apedestrian pr0m- r

enade  from_ the intersection’ of
Bigelow ~ Boulevard and Forbes
Avenue to Schenley Fountain. A large,‘

open space at the north end of the park '

vas, on which the programs of a com-
munity can ‘play themselves out,”
McIntosh said “It really is a stage for
public life;” -

G. Reynolds Clark, 'Pitt’s vice
chancellor for community and govern-
mental relations, explained that Pitt is
part of the committee coordinating the
design phase of the project ‘Other
members of this committee include
Pittsbur_gh’s Department of City

, Planning, the. Oakland Task Force, the

Allegheny Conference on Community
Development,’ the Pittsburgh Parks
Conservancy and Carnegie Mellon

V University, among others.‘ _

* “We would likexto turn it back to
the grand entrance ‘to Schenley Park

- that it was many years ago,” Clark said.

Pitt has also been instrumental in

S gathering funding for the project. Clark
"said that the cost of developing the

plaza itself is about $5 million, while
the surrounding road improvements
would cost another $1.6 million. He
explained that the City of Pittsburgh

loﬂicials informed the comrriitteethat

“I’d like to see this project work,”
said Lawrence Breck, an Oakland

Resident for 34 years,‘ “but we’ ve got

Carolyn Carson, head of PitI’s
urban studies department, also men-
tioned some concerns she had about
removing the parking.

“People use Hillman Library at .

night, graduate students from ’Posvar
and the School of Business are leaving

the area at night,” she said. “It’s jtist far  

enough that women are going to feel

‘ Susan‘ Golomb, director of
Pittsburgh’s Department of City
Planning, explained that when Mary
Schenley sold the property to the City
of Pittsburgh, she stipulated that it be
used for a public park, and therefore
Schenley Plaza technically carmot be

engineers determined that the cost of

MICHELLE Scorr
Senior Staff Writer

Kermit the Frog once said, “It’s not easy
being green,” but Pitt’s School of
Engineering is working to ﬁnd ways to
make research on building, living, and think-
ing “green” alittle easier. ‘

Yesterday, the School of Engineering
dedicated the Mascaro Sustainability
Initiative, or MSI, which will build on Pitt’s
current programs in green construction. John
C. Mascaro, an alumnus of the School of
Engineering, provided a lead  past
week to establish the initiative, which has
also received ﬁmding from the Heinz
Foundation and the bequest of George
Bevier. The MSI will be co—directed by Eric
Beckman, chair of Pitt’s department" of
chemical and petroleum engineering, and
GenaKovalcik.

According to the Environmental

Protection Agency, the term “sustainability” _

refers to “structures and designs that cause
no overall net burden or deﬁcit to a commu-
nity of the world in general.” This concept
comes into play in “green construction,” in
which builders must consider a st1uct11re’s
total economic and enviromnental impact,
measured by the raw materials it uses, its

construction, its maintenance and its dispos- I

al or re-use.
“What we’re trying to ﬁgure out as sci-

, entists and engineers is: How do we enhance

our quality of life while reducing the impact
on the ecosystem?’ ’V Beckman said
Beckrnan explained that the’Mascaro
Sustainability Initiative will expand and
change the current green construction pro-
grams in the civil engineering department.
Many researchers at Pitt have already made
developments in environmental sustainabili-

ty, including Anthony Deardo and c. Isaac .
Garcia of the materials science and engi- .

neering department. They studied the rea-
sons why putting lead in steel makes it easi-
er to machine, and then replaced the lead
with tin, which keeps the steel malleable but
reduces itsnegative impact on the environ-
ment. Their lead-free, or “green,” steel is
now in trial with a number of manufacturers.

In 2004, the MSI will provide seed

 “Green” rnrtiative dedicated

grants for post-doctoral students, faculty
members and undergraduates doing research
over the summer to study green construc-
tion, water usage and other topics in envi-
ronmental sustainability. One of the main
goals of this initiative, Beckrnan said, is to
foster collaboration among dilferent depart-
ments in the School of Engineering, and
among different schools at Pitt.
. “I’m bettingpon the faculty to come up
with some really good ideas,” Beclqnan
said, “and I think it’s a good bet.” ’
Next year, the MSI will put out propos-
als for educational programs on sustainabili-

, ty, and it  hold its ﬁrst biannual confer-

ence on environmental sustainability in the
spring of 2005. Beckman explained that the
ultimate goal of the initiative is to establish

- an internationally recognized center on sus-

tainable engineering, and that these individ-

ual programs will establish the pillars for the i

center.

John, or Jack, Mascaro, whograduated
from Pitt’s school of engineering in 1966,
has been “one of our most loyal alumni,”
and a strong supporter of green construction,
Beckman said. Mascaro, the founder of’
Mascaro’ Construction, has also created a

.high-tech classroom for Pitt’s civil engineer-

ing department and developed a program on
construction management at Pitt.

Mascaro explained that the concept of ‘

green building is becoming increasingly
important to the construction industry, since

more clients are beginning to require it _in ‘

their buildings. He said that he hopes stu-
dents will see this initiative as an opportuni-
ty to do research in_ this “dinosaur industry
we call construction.” He added that improv-
ing productivity in the construction industry
is signiﬁcant because the industry makes up
8 percent of the United States’ gross nation-
a1pr0duct- , , ,     1,7 .  
Mascaro also said I that Mascaro
Construction buﬂt the ﬁrst green building in
Pittsburgh, the CNG Tower, in 1992. He

. added that because the  building move-

ment was still in its neophyte stages at that

time, it does not have green certiﬁcation.
Beckrnan added that the Heinz

Foundation and George Bevier have also

given strong support for bioengineering and

environmental sustainability. Bevier, who
graduated from the School of Engineering in
.1913, created a trust in the 1960s‘that .
became available to Pitt in 2003. The Bevier
 the ' largest gift ever received by the
School of Engineering, amounted to almost
$l1 million. I .

Clark explained that Schenley Plaza
makes up only 2 percent of the ‘available
parking spaces in Oakland," and to compen-
sate for the loss of parking spaces, the
Allegheny Conference on Community
Development will run a study examining the
current parking situation in Oakland and
how it could be improved.

" ‘‘It’s a matter of providing information
so that people know other places to park,” he

said, adding that spaces are also _available
underneath Sennott Square, in the lots
between Fifth and Forbes, and in the garage
beneath the Soldiers and Sailors’ Memorial.

Golomb said that she hopes the renova-
tion of Schenley Plaza will begin next
spring. The construction, which must also
allow for the next planting season, would be
completed next spring. .

“I think that this is an incredible oppor-
tunity to change what is a not—permitted and
unattractive use of a space to a real amenity

for us,” Golomb said .

New $1,000 fee for next year’sfreshmen

Bad news for next year’s class:
Pitt will be assessing a $1,000 fee
to all incoming full—time in-state
freshmen starting next September.

But is this bad news for Pitt?
The University needs the money,
since it and all other state—related
colleges have seen their federal and
state funding slashed.

If Harrisburg won’t give, and
alumni are feeling the current eco-
nomic squeeze, then students have
to pay.

Still, in light of the tuition
increases over the past few years,

‘$1,000 for in-state students, and

$500 from out—of—state ones, on top
of higher tuition, is a lot to ask.

And because this is a surcharge,
rather than a straight tuition hike, it
makes financial aid tricky. Some
Pitt scholarships like the
University and Challenge scholar-
ships — cover tuition only.

Also, Stafford loans, one of the
main federal programs, only offer
$2,625 in subsidized loans to fresh-
man and increase that amount every
year, so that the people paying this
fee will be offered the smallest
amount.

Chancellor Nordenberg, in an
Oct. 16 article in the Pittsburgh
Post—Gazette, cited Pitt’s desire to
compete with private schools as the
reason behind the new fee.

But Pitt is not a private school
— and its mission should be to
serve the public rather than just the
moneyed.

Also,
admissions standards — by raising
the minimum grade point average,
SAT score and class rank needed to
attend the Oakland campus, and
raising tuition as ‘well —- Pitt seems
to have forgotten that rich doesn’t
always equal smart.

Rather than making college pro-
hibitively expensive, Shouldn’t
Pitt’s mission include educating
people who could not afford a pri-
vate school education?

Shouldn’t that be the primary
mission of a state-related school -
serving the state’s residents?

At least Pitt is giving incoming
undergraduates fair warning, rather
than hiking their fees mid—college.

Vice Chancellor for Public
Affairs Robert Hill commented in
the Post—Gazette that, “Those who
are already enrolled have some
expectations about tuition. Those

. who have yet to enroll don’t. Those

who have yet to enroll will know
before they come here.”

So no one will be surprised —
but some students who are quali-
fied, but broke, might choose to
attend another school, and that
would be both Pitt’s and their loss.

Creation- frustration and a TV. station

Sunday afternoon. Half of the actors are

-hung over. We’re three hours into shooting“ a

simple four—page script in a classroom and
the director can’t stop laughing. He’s making
one of the actors to repeat the line, “Ye-th,
Profe-th-or!” so manytimes that the words
have lost all meaning. I’m the professor he’s
referring to. Outside of wearing a bowtie and
a jacket with suede elbow patches, I thought
it would be an especially good touch if I’d
shave the top of my head to give me that per-
fect “professory” look Now I
that’s dedication.

My legs ached. Everyone .
was getting antsy. We’d end up’

several more takes and one
broken camera later.
Sacriﬁcing this Sunday was
just one of the many conces-
sions I gladly made in the name
of my biggest dream — giving
the world my very own low-
grade, college TV sketch com-
edy show. I was ﬁnally present-
ed with the chance early last ' ‘
year with the advent of the Creation Station
— motto: Seriously bad name, seriously bad
TV — Pitt’s brand-new TV station. In the
name of this dream, I attempted to buildup
a show from scratch, with absolutely no
experience, with only these two hands.

A month later I compiled a crew, named
the show .“Headhunter,” but I can’t remem-
ber why, and I took the reins as producer.
Initially, the show stank. The premise of one
of the ﬁrst skits — which I’ll admit I wrote

- — entails a girl talking her ﬁiend out of

committing suicide by oﬂ’ering her a yogurt.

It barely got better when the writing
team thought of theseideas: Yassar Arafat as
a high school guidance counselor,’ “Fried
Green Tomatoes” the Musical, Fast-talking
I.opsided-head Man, Winnie the Porno and
a prepubescent centaur going to a school
dance. For every ten ideas thought up, nine-
and-a-half were really bad and the rest
maybe could be worked with. To date, our

most widely acclaimed skit is Billy and His 0
Crazy Talking Wiener, which'I think really . ,

resonated with the frat community.

I quickly discovered how annoyingly '

tedious it is .to c“r’eate anything ‘for TV.
Making hundreds of phone calls; scavenger
hunting for ridiculous props: a moose’s head
and a vatof chocolate pudding; and expend-
ing hours at a shoot qnly to end up with a
tape where 75 percent of it is useless is only
half of the job. Editing — this step is easily
the hair—pulling crazy-maker
— as I’ ve found that every sin-
gle rriinute of television usually
requires at least an hour of
postproduction editing. I’d
spend night after night in a
claustrophobic hole on the 11th
ﬂoor of the Cathedral — my
face staring into the computer
screen maintaining that glazed
over, hanging-jaw, serene cow
expression that only comes
from prolonged sleep depriva-
tion, my arched seated position
causing muscles in my back to
pulse and swell, my ﬁngers methodically
darting about the mouse and keyboard in
front of me —— meticulously splicing and
rearranging footage from a scene of three old
ladies attacking each other with canes. I once
did this for 22 hotus straight. I soon found

U.S. needs educational funding, not as space race

In the early ’60s, not long after the inception
of the U.S.—Soviet space race, then-President John
Kennedy pledged that the United States would put
a man on the moon before the end of the decade.

"This was the diplomatic equivalent of saying,

“I’m gonna whip it out and measure, and, God
help you, NASA, I damn well better be bigger
than Khrushchev.”

Now that China — the new Communist
Superpower — has put a man in space, a similar sit-
uation arises, but this time, it has very little scien-
tiﬁc irnport. The Chinese are more than 40 years
behind, and while it won’t take them 40 years to

' catch up, it will be years before they are in a posi-

tion to‘ do something we haven’t.

But our current president seems to view
every international incident as a ruler —— Bush
would probably say yardstick .— against which he
might measure himself. Yes, whether you agree
with his policies or not, you have to admit that
Bush sometimes behaves a lot like a cowboy,
putting pride -— whether national or personal —
ahead of prudence.

In the next year or so, it-bears watching how
Bush responds to the Chinese accomplishments.

Ifhe mentions Mars even once, we should jettison .

him like a ﬁrst-stage booster rocket

' Spaceﬂight costs ﬂie United States billions of
dollars even when NASA is working at a mere
fraction of full—tilt I’m not qualiﬁed to say how,

' much another space race would cost us, but I ﬁnd

it obvious that it is more money than we, as a
nation, have. Business is not, strictly speaking,
booming, and we have yet to be absolved of our

national debt The ﬁrst space race brought us
much more than pride and Tang — communica-
tions and weather satellites, and improvements in
education, for instance. But while we should cer-
tainly uy to at least retum to our pre-.Columbia-
crash level of space activity, we have little to gain
from regarding the Chinese success as a challenge
to be met. Moreover, China’s human rights record
indicates that its govern-
ment might not really care
about its citizens, who are
not nearly as well off as
the average American, and
who will probably suffer
the consequences of their
govemment’s massive
expenditures on" the bur-
geoning Chinese space’
program We should not

blue-collar jobs in manufacturing willlikely be
done overseas. By funding schools, new jobs will
open up for teachers, textbook publishers, janitors,
construction workers, security personnel in dan-
gerous schools, among many others. Bush’s No
Child Left Behind policy is just that — a policy.
We have a new policy on education practically
every presidential term, and by the time it has
taken effect, before we can ever judge its suc-
cess, it’s phased out. Most schools would
rather just get a check from the government, so
they can spend money on books, rather than
spending money they don’t have to conform to
another new policy.

This is perhaps the highest priority in any
space program, because, as in any science-
based industry, the mind is the most valuable
asset. We’d also need to limit our spending and
repair our ailing economy, so that, a decade

‘from now, we’ll have the money to spend on

or triple their efforts to
keep pace with ours. !

If Bush feels the need to invest in our space
program he should start at the foundations. We’d
have more potential aerospace engineers if our
chﬂdren learn high-level math, and a larger pool
from which to draw if we focus on disadvantaged"

‘ school districts. If we want to compete with the

Chinese when their space program becomes truly
formidable, we need to invest in our education
system

Sure, bolstering our space program will cre-
ate new jobs, but such jobs will be «reserved for
college-educated ‘engineers and scientists. The

what may become another space race.

If Bush wants to keep his job next
November, Americans should see an irrrprove—
ment in education, or, at the very least, a commit-
ment to success, measured not in words or pro-
grams, but in dollars. In addition, the national bud-
get should be in the black, and more Americans
should be in the workplace, not in the unemploy-

This semester, Amnesty will be aiding International

featuring some great artists?

The Channel is one of Pittsburgh’s best—kept

VV1th energy that surpasses even the
most rocking of rock bands, and the musi-
cal ability to blend their instruments as if
they were a 12-piece orchestra, Zox brings
four instruments together to create a great
sound.

Zox, a foursome from Providence, R.I.,
brings a mixture of ﬁmk, rock, reggae, punk
and classical music all into one and ﬁnds a
way to make it work.

And tonight at Carnegie Mellon
University, they bring it all to Pittsburgh for
a free show.

Their album, Take Me Home, is ﬁlled
with energy from beginning to end, with
four—minute tracks that go from groovy reg-
gae to a fast, popping ska feel.

The band members mix their inﬂu-
ences and put all of their musical ingenuity
into their songs. Like snowﬂakes, no two
Zox songs are the same.

Conservatory—trained Spencer Swain

Eclectic blend of music rocks

provides energy and powerful melodies as
he romps around on stage, tearing away at
the violin, adding an extra musical and visu-
al touch to a band that already has a vibe
that stands above the rest of the musical
masses.

., Zox has opened for such national acts
as Rusted Root, Dispatch, Guster,
Goldﬁnger, The Starting Line and The
Sugar Hill Gang. Zox takes on elements of
each of these national acts, and mixes them.

Picture a few of these acts fusing to
create powerful, interesting music. That is
the sound that Zox brings to the table; that is
the sound that Zox will bring to Pittsburgh.

Zox will be performing a free, all ages
show at the Underground at Carnegie
Mellon University, tonight at 8:30 p.m.,
with Overdue and The Girls. For more

Pitt’s men’s basketball team getsready for new season

MICHAEL CUNNINGHAM
Senior Staff Writer

It all started 32 years ago, when leg-
endary coach Lefty Driesell invited stu-
dents to watch his Maryland basketball
squad run its armual mile around the
football ﬁeld. Over 500 people showed
up, and Midnight Madness was born.

For the Panthers, it all started in
2000, when the Pitt athleticsdepartment
got together with the Pitt Program
Council, printed some free T-shirts and
invited fans to come out to Fitzgerald
Field House and get to know Pitt’s young
2000 men’s and women’s basketball

teams. Thousands of students showed up
to witness the beginning of NCAA-man-
dated practices for the Panther basketball
squads, and Midnight Madness became
an annual event at Pitt.

A lot has changed in the four years
since that first Midnight Madness at the
Field House. The Pitt men’s squad, once
a basement dweller in the Big East, has
had its two most successful seasons in
school history, boasting a Big East
Player of the Year — Brandin Knight —
in . 2002, wining the Big JEast
Championship in 2003 and reaching the

‘Sweet 16 of the NCAA Tournament in

consecutive years.

"Clown Prince of Pocket
Billiards”  

Both the men’s and women’s squads
moved into the Petersen Events Center in
2002, and both teams have new head
coaches this year. Jamie Dixon, an assis-
tant under former men’s head basketball
coach Ben Howland, will take over the
reins for his mentor this season, in the
wake of Howland’s departure to UCLA.

For the women’s squad, which has not '

enjoyed the success of its male counter-
part the last few seasons, Agnus
Berenato will bring some much-needed
enthusiasm —— as well as 14 seasons of
successful head coaching experience at
Georgia Tech.

Last year’s Midnight Madness

attracted national media attention, as
longtime ESPN and CBS Sports analyst
Billy Raftery was master of ceremonies
for the event. Unfortunately, it also
attracted controversy, as it provided the
backdrop for the much—maligned, wrist-
band—based student season ticket lottery
system. '

Raftery isn’t slated to be there this
season, but neither is the controversy, as
Pitt has already sold out its student sea-
son tickets. What will occur at the 2003
installment of Midnight Madness are the
contests, ticket giveaways and. scrim-
mages that students have come -to know
and love over the last four years.

' A three-point shootout will give six
fans a chance to win $5,000, and one stu-
dent will have an opportunity to sink a
half—court shot for $10,000. Both the
men’s and women’s teams will have 10-
minute scrimmages at midnight, fol-
lowed by a men’s slam-dunk contest and
a co-ed three-point contest. .

For men’s forward Levon Kendall,
the most important feature that séparates

Midnight Madness from the September

grind is the presence of the fans.

“It’s deﬁnitely nice to get the fans
outthere,” Kendall said. “You get used
to playing in an empty gym for the first
month and a half of practice, and it’s nice
to get some fan base out there and see
that everyone is excited for the season.”

. Guard Julius Page, who burst onto
the scene as a freshman with some high-
ﬂying theatrics at the 2000 Midnight
Madness, says he is most excited about

seeing this year’s freshman class, per- ]

form in front of the crowd.

“I think Midnight Madness is some-
thing for the freshmen,” Page said.
“Everybody knows what the starters look

like, and I think that this is a great chance ‘I

for the fansyand for the other guys on the,
team to seewhat the freshmen can do.”
Page, who has won the last two

slam-dunk competitions, will be unable‘
to compete in the slam-dunk contest this .

year because of an injury, and his pick to

take the crown this year is a fellow alum,-C"

nus of Turner—Carr_oll High School.
“I’ve got to keep it with the Buffalo
crew; I’ve got ‘to go with Ed Turner,”
Page said. “He’s going to winit hands
down. That’s easy; no contest.” '
' While Page’s choice of Turner puts a
lot of pressure on the freshman forward,
his pick to win the three—pointcompeti-

tion puts just as much pressure on him- r

self. . _
This year, Page will attempt to‘ do
what Michael Jordan never could: win

. the three-point competition in addition to

thedunk contest. But according to Page,
there won’t be any competition to speak
of. ‘ ' '

“Maybe sdmebody on the girls’ team
will give me" some competition, but
nobody on my team will give me any
competition.’-’

Pitt prepares for Scarlet Knights

Rutgers, page 9

the Notre Dame defensive line was overpow-
ering the Panther offensive line. '

“Coach Ham's challenged us to be more
physical,” Petitti said. “We’1l be a lot better
from here on out.”

For Petitti,' this is an extra special road
game, for he is going to his home state to play
in front of a bunch of friends and family.

“I’ve got like 60 fans coming down,”
Petitti said. '
Harriott is also excited for this game.

He isn’t going home, but his friend,
William Beckford, plays at the linebacker posi-
tion for the Scarlet Knights. They both attend-

ed Glades Central High School in Belle Glade,
Fla

“I used to take him to church with me,”
Haniott added with a chuckle. They haven’t
spoken since the beginning of the season, but
Haniott says he might have to give Beckford a
call. “We’ve been waiting for this for a while.”

The Panthers will start Jawan Walker at
running back for the third straight week.
Rumiing back Brandon Miree will sit out
again.
“We’re going to take a little slower
approach to his rehab,” Harris said. He also

said it was quite possible that Raymond
Kirkley will see some playing time on .

Saturday.

Gonzalez sets records in Panthers’  
double—overtime win against Rutgers

Greatest Games, page 9

On to double overtime. This time,
Pitt went on offense ﬁrst, and Holfart

, caught his third touchdown of the after-

noon, putting Pitt up 55-48.

Rutgers could not score on its pos-
session, so the ball game — ﬁnally —
ended.

‘To come out here and hit up on .

Dan Marino is something,” Gonzalez
said. “I’11 have to joke with him about

Holfart had 12 catches for 134 yards

Schulters picked up 150 yards rushing

But as impressive as the offense
was, the defense and the special teams

The defense gave up a whopping

Panthers failed on ﬁve of 10 ﬁeld goal
and extra point attempts. ’
