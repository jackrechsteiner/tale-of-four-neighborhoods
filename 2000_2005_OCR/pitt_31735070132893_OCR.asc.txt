Greeks auctioemslves

Staff Report

‘In classic MTV style, brothers
and sisters of Pitt’s Greek commu-
nity danced, sang and-even shook
their ,“bon bons” across Club Laga’s
stage at the Greek Auction.

The event, hosted by MTV
celebrity Eric Nies, benefited the
Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS
Foundation, I '

The Greek community united to

raise more than $13,000 for the,

night’s event. .

Nies, a veteran of the first sea-
son of the “Real World” in New
York City and former host of the

“Grind,” is now a TV producer and '

volunteer for charitable organiza-
tions; V, ,3, 

“Before I got into the%ﬂ;e‘rI;tertain—.
ment business, I never tﬁﬁught of
[volunteering] and then changed
my mind,” Nies said.  V5 , -

“A little sparkle went-"off and
said this is what I should be doing.”

Following in the spirit of chari-
ty, brothers from Pitt’s fraternities
auctioned themselves, while Pitt’s
sorority sisters auctioned off mem-
orabilia, including a pair of Delta
Zeta shorts and a sweatshirt signed
by Dan Marino. ,

The Greek community started
fundraising for this AIDS founda-
tion before the auction; each frater-
nity or sorority used the money they
raised to place bids at the auction.

The event was just used as a
way to get the Greek community
together for an entertaining
evening.

In past years, sisters had auc-
tioned themselves, but this year

   

"they decided to auction items

instead because they did not want to
offend their national organizations.

Nicki Romba, a sister from Chi
Omega who was serving as a Greek
Week overall, said she wanted to
make sure all the rules were fol-
lowed and the Pitt Greek communi-

Students learn to defend themselvesat seminar

MALLORY WOMER
Staff Writer

“Get those knee strikes in,”
called out Curtis Smith to a room
filled by about 50 Pitt students
learning to defend themselves.
“That’s your bread and butter.”

On Tuesday night, the Pitt
Program Council hosted a self-
defense seminar, where Smith
taught Pitt students who wanted to
feel more comfortable traveling in

;the city late at night some basic

moves that can be used to fend off
attackers.

“You always hear stories,”
Freshman Kate Styer said. “So you
can’t think that it won’t happen to
you.”

While most of the stories Styer

spoke about involve young women

walking alone at night, not all vic-

tims fit that stereotype. In a room
filled with women, Daniel Cielecy, a
sophomore and the only male partic-
ipant in attendance, was focused
solely on learning defensive tech-
niques.

“I’m not going to take it for
granted that I can defend myself,”
Cielecy said. “I want to know how.
It’s a skill. It’s not something that
you pick up instinctively, no matter
how big you are.”

Smith is both a police officer
and a teacher in the physical educa-

tion department at Pitt. He holds '

master ranks in many different
forms of martial arts, including jiu-
jitsu, a form of grappling and joint
manipulation. «

Smith is also responsible for
designing the “Buy Yourself a
Minute: Protection Against Assault”
program, from which he drew most

of the information given out to stu-
dents on Tuesday. He created it after
graduating from Pitt in 1976. It was
first taught for credit at Carnegie
Mellon University before it became
a class at Pitt.

“Every class, we have someone
who has been physically or sexually
assaulted,” Smith said. “Sometimes
we have those great stories of peo-
ple who have graduated the class

and successfully warded off attack-

9,

ers.

Smith had this list of advice for
students in the case of an attack:

-The heel of the palm hasalot
of fatty tissue, which
makes it‘an ideal weapon for strik-
ing attackers.

-When in a situation where you
are being attacked, it is very impor-
tant to yell. Yelling not only gets

other people’s attention, but it also

raises your adrenaline level.

-The elbows are the second
hardest enamel in the body. For
some, the elbow strike is the most
powerful weapon of defense because
it utilizes only one‘ joint in theibody.

-When in a dangerous situation,
the peripheral vision is diminished,
which leaves you to rely on tunnel
vision. Also, the finer motor skills
are not at an optimum level, which
is why you must use the larger mus-
cle groups when trying to defend
yourself from an attacker.

-Sometimes it’s necessary to
draw in the attacker in order to get
away from them. The knee (strike, a
sharp, quick blow with the‘ knee, 
often the most. devastating skill
when executed correctly, and
requires the -victim to grab the
attacker around the neck and pul
him in close. .

Contemporary writers read
their works as part of series

ADAM FLEMING
Staff Writer

A published book is a journey of
a thousand miles.

Three emerging authors attested
to the trials of writing for publica-
tion at a reading in the
Contemporary Writers Series last
Monday.’

“We want to introduce you to
people who have gone through the
gauntlet of trying to publish a
book,” Lee Gutkind, a professor of
English at Pitt, said before they
spoke.

The night’s first reader, Anahita
Firouz, worked as a writer for 25
years before her first book was pub-
lished. She read from her debut
novel, “In the Walled Gardens.”

Firouz began with the ‘first chap-
ter from her tale of a Marxist revolu-
tionary and a married, upper-class
woman in Iran in 1976.

She then moved to an emotional
prison scene, where a father visits
his incarcerated’ son. The audience
responded with silence. '

To’ contrast the somber prison
scene, Firouz read a comically disas-
trous party scene from the novel.

“A lot of my readers really love
[this scene], because everything is
going wrong,” Firouz said, before
tearing into a catalog of quarreling

_servants, sassy waiters, clogged toi-

lets and failing electricity.

Firouz concluded her portion of S

the event by reading a selection from
the novel that highlighted what ‘she
felt was at the crux of the division
and misunderstanding between peo-
ple of Eastern and Western cultures.

The father from the aforemen-
tioned prison scene meets with a
French journalist.

“Things don’t go as the father
expects, nor as the journalist
expects,” Firouz said.

The scene dealt with a discus-
sion of why the father’s son was
imprisoned. It concluded with the
father storming out, terribly offend-
ed.

Next to take the stage, Joel
Brouwer read from his two pub-
lished collections of poetry, along
with three unpublished poems.

Brouwer’s first book, “Exactly
What Happened,” featured poems

with titles taken directly from news-
paper headlines.

_ “What this book is really about
is the impossibility of figuring out
what happened,” Brouwer said.

He read poems that dissected the
connotative meanings behind life
found in space, a rampaging ele-
phant and the arrest of a Kenyan
Parliament member for the crime of
imagining the death of the president.

Brouwer’s second book of
poems, the aptly titled “Centuries,”
presented prose poems, all. of exact-
ly 100 words. I’ A

“[It] is a challenge that I set for
myself, probably because I need
medication,” Brouwer said.

Brouwer’s poems elicited laugh-
ter from the audience, but tended to
silence the crowd with particularly
shocking revelations, such as the
fact that the elephant was shot 40
times before she died.

“Of course, the [book] you’re
always most excited about is the one
you haven’t published yet,” Brouwer
said before concluding with three of
his new poems. .

More than an hour into the pro-
gram, Mark Rotella approached the
microphone with a small minority of
audience members getting up to
leave.

“Well, thank you all for com-
ing,” Rotella said, “and thank you
all for staying.”

Some of those not with their

‘backs to Rotella laughed.

Rotella read two passages from
his memoir, “Stolen Figs and Other
Adventures in Calabria.”

“It was first an exploration of
family; [it] became an exploration of
a region,” Rotella said.

His work reflected a lifetime of’
stories and experiences. Rotella
traced his lineage through the Italian
countryside and told of his determi-
nation to gain Italian citizenship,
occasionally pausing to relay an
anecdote, such as his first bocce
game, which he played with a bel-
ligerent, elderly Italian person.

Rotella finished with a revela-
tion about the inevitable futility of
his mission to be fully accepted by
the people of another culture.

The audience applauded, then '

dispersed to a reception outside of
the Frick Fine Arts Auditorium.

 

In yesterday’s paper, The Pitt News incorrectly identiﬁed John Lyne. The
Pitt News regrets the error.

New Pitt center
to try to fix
local schools

ANASTASIA STERANKO
Staff Writer

More than half of the students in the
Pittsburgh Public School District scored at
or below the basic level on their
Pennsylvania System School of

Assessment tests, according to the Web site

for the mayor’s commission on public edu-
cation. '

In an attempt to solve the problems of
the area’s' failing school districts, Pitt creat-
ed a new center for urban education. The
center’s focus will be on working with local
schools to develop effective educational
programs.

The center, which is based in Pitt’s

School of Education and was introduced,

will. give its students real world experience

. in an urban environment.

One of the pilot projects of the center is
the creation of a partnership with the
Wilkinsburg School District. Working with
the school board, and administr-ators and
teachers in the district, the center will devel-
op effective programs and educational
information structures.

Another project of the new center
involves a professional development pro-
gram at Phillips Elementary School.

' Phillips will provide a helpful resource for

Pitt students to gain practical experience in
dealing with urban issues."

In the future, undergraduate students
will have the opportunity to mentor or tutor
at Phillips.

Barbara Rudiak, Phillips’ principal,
was recognized as Pennsylvania’s National
Distinguished - Principal ' for A 2003.
Proponents of the center, including School
of Education Dean Alan Lesgold, hope that
Pitt will also be able to learn from the expe-

rience of teachers and’ administrators such

as Rudiak.
“Because of the creation of this center,
we can all be more hopeful for the future of

this region,” Chancellor Mark Nordenberg '

said at the introduction of the center.

Don’t force busy students to be nice, too

A state representative wants to
foist even more graduation require-
ments onto college students across the
state.

Mike Veon, D-Beaver, said on
Monday he plans to introduce legisla-
tion this week that would add a 25-
hour per year public service obliga-
tion to the curricula of state-operated
universities in Pennsylvania.

Everyone knows typical college
students are just aching for something
to occupy their time. It’s not as if they
have classes, hours of homework,
extracurricular commitments, jobs
and even families vying for their
time. ~

Of course volunteering is a nice
thing to do. It would be great if every
college student had the time and incli-
nation to better their community. The
fact is, they don’t. Legislating nice-
ness is unrealistic. .,

Students pay — and pay dearly —
to attend college. It’s unfair to force
free labor out of them in addition to
charging the thousands of dollars they
have to somehow come up with.

Depending on the type of labor
students would be forced to do, train-
ing and overseeing them will cost a
pretty penny —— and Pennsylvania has
cash just lying around waiting to be
spent.

Most students will resent A the
intrusion on their time. Having a surly

young person volunteering in, say, a
nursing home is a great idea.

Some students — those admirable
lads and lasses — already volunteer.
It’s important enough to them to make
time to do community service, and
they should be commended. Volunteer
work looks great on a -resume — until
every other college graduate has it,
too. This measure will render their
time and devotion practically mean-
ingless.

Many students travel far from
home to attend school, and will leave
the city and even state they went to
school in upon graduation. What’s the
point in instilling civic pride in some-
one who won’t be around to see the
beneﬁts and remain invested in the
well-being of a city or state?

Getting young people excited
about public service is an excellent
idea. Volunteering betters communi-
ties and the people who do it.
However, forcing already busy people
to, in effect," pay twice for their edu-
cation — once with money, and once
with labor — isn’t the way to do it‘.

College isn’t the time or place for
a program like the one Veon’s propos-
ing. By the time they hit college, most
people have their values formed and
their time spoken for.

Pick on high school kids. They’re

jsponging off the state as it is, and

they're young and healthy.

Word tomy lmother  and my father

My older brother accomplished just
about everything parents have night-
mares about, all before he graduated
high school. My parents knew — by
heart —— the number of the school and
the home line of a policeman. I’m~ two
years younger than he is, and Iwatched
— and was watched — from afar during
the saga of our adolescence. While my
parents focused their attention on my
brother, I made my own decisions about
my life. . .

My friends’ families are a little dif-
ferent. A few friends of mine were never
allowed to make any decisions for them-
selves — their overbearing parents sti-'
ﬂed any sense of self-conﬁdence or
independence they had. I’m
not surprised one of my
friends couldn’t wait to.
leave for college — I’ve
been a witness to her moth-
er’s constant criticisms. Her
ideas, intelligence, and even
her body were all targets for
her ,mom’s verbal venom.
Since I’ve been at Pitt, a few
fellow freshmen have men-
tioned how glad they are to
be away from their parents
for _sirriilar reasons. Many
were just glad to be, away from what
they described as their parents’ constant
intrusive concern.

I wouldn’t know anything about
that. I really miss my parents —— because
throughout my life they trusted me to
make my own decisions and basically
left me alone. Conversely, my brother
was the focus of their unvarying, con-
centrated attention — he became accus-
tomed to relying on them for everything
and never learned to make decisions for
his own good. He went off to college and
dropped out before the end of theyear.

Intentionally or not, my parents’

stayed respectfully the hell out of my

way, and I got used to the idea that my I

decisions would affect only me. IfI did
poorly in school, Mom and Dad weren’t
going to yell at me. W"1thoutia value sys-
tem being forced upon me, I had to cre-
ate one of my own. I became cognizant
of the real-life consequences of my
actions and performed according to the
outcome I wanted. I began to be disap-
pointed with myself if I didn’t achieve
the scores I sought.

Kids need to be trusted —— my fami-
ly is living proof. I learned to ride a bike

P by having my dad hang on to it just until

I gained my balance. Independence is
taught the same way. My parents trusted
that I’d catch my balance, and even if I
fell, that I would pick myself up again.
They hung on to the side of
.my_’ brother’s bike long after
he had not only grown too
big for it, but had also grown
a beard and an attitude to
match.
As an attention-starved
preteen, their minimalist
_ approach to parenting used
to really upset me, until I.
realized that it was the best
thing they could have done
for me. I’m happy with who

I am now because I became '

who I wanted to be — not who they
wanted me to be. As a result, -all parties
involved are happy with the way I’ve
turned out, so far at least.

I have pictures of my parents taped
up all over my room. I call them alot,
particularly when I need advice or just a
wise opinion. When anything of impor-
tance, great or honible, happens to me,
they are the first I think to tell. Our rela-

, tionship now is the happy product of

many years of mutual respect, a method
that deserves to be tried.

Is geography a realistic governmental determinant?

About three years ago, I
saw Lech Walesa, former
Polish prime minister and
solidarity leader, speak at a,
small college outside my
hometown. I didn’t know
who he was, but his introduc-
tion proclaimed he had
played a key role in bringing

policies have had on his vil-
lage. Apparently the victims
care. Butwe weren’t taught
to recognize imperialism of
this sort. Our imperialism is
defined by ﬂags and foreign
guns.

But, we don’t» have to
look to the world as a whole

about the end of the Cold to see the tensions created by
War. So, I ﬁgured it might - Columnist our attachment to geography
pay to listen fairly carefully. in this post—industrial world.

He spoke in Polish, with
an enthusiasm that occasion-
ally ﬂustered the translator. I’ve forgotten
most of the speech by now, but one part
has stuck with me. It wasn’t the conclu-

sion of any reasoning he presented. It was’

more of an aside. In the midst of talking
about progress and the future of the
world, he questioned the effectiveness of
geographical sovereignty. He said that
perhaps a change would be necessary. '

I tried to get him to elaborate, but the
line for ‘questions was long and time
short. I left struggling with the question
of what he could have possibly meant by
that. I’ve been mulling it over for the past
few years.

The idea of sovereignty being geo-
graphic grew out of common sense. My
country is between this mountain and that
river. That seems an acceptable way of
doing things. People between this moun-

‘ tain and that river will live and work

between this mountain and that river.
They will pay taxes to me, will be pro-
vided for by me and we will be a city or a

On the other side of the river is

' another city or state. We don’t have much

to _do with them. .Our business is here, we
have jurisdiction here. I can’t take "over

that country without physically invading ‘

it. And each established area would be,
for the most part, self-sustaining.

_ let-*§”~tl1is understanding of sovereignty«
andinvasions that we have been taught

and raised with. Now, it seems the world

is moving away from that. The age. of

globalization has usheredin a new sort of

‘invasion, an invasion that doesn’t require

a physical marching across borders.

It’s an economic imperialism. It‘

results in just as much control by the con-
quering nation, or nations, but without all
the blood‘ and politics of war. It’s more
subtle, more cunning and hard to even
notice unless you’re the one being taken
over.

But over 40 Bolivians have died in
the pastimonth protesting" just such an

invasion by the United States. Of course,_

we’ve had practically dictatorial econom-
ic control there for a while. It was more of
an insurgency, a colonial uprising against
the local governor, President Lozada.

’ - A bit over a month ago, a South

Korean man stabbed himself at a World ‘

Trade Organization meeting in Cancun,
Mexico, in protest of the effects their

In Pittsburgh — admit-

tedly not as intense as the

deadly Bolivian situation ——- the tensions
are starkly apparent. We have a budget

crisis. And while the city doesn’t have
sovereignty over its boundaries, it does
have some powers of taxation that it can
exercise within its geographic bound-
aries.

The city can tax the 330,000 people
whosleep here at night. The problem is,
the population of Pittsburgh during the
day — the number of people actually uti-
lizing the city — is closer to 600,000. But
they mostly live outside the city. So, that
old “I tax these people, I provide for these
people” reasoning sort of falls apart, and
there are unemployed police officers and
bus cutbacks.

Sure, we have some nuisance taxes

and liquor taxes that suburbanites have to
pay when they come. But for the most
part, it’s the city folk who pave the roads
they drive in on and pay the cops who
protect them during their workdays. And
it’s only this way because powers of tax-
ation are deﬁned geographically.

So, what am I proposing? I’m not
quite sure. I’m not a political revolution-
ary — at least not yet. I’m just asking you

The original “Texas Chainsaw

Nickel Creek ﬂows

Bluegrass’ favorite sons —— and daughter -——
Nickel Creek will bring their acoustic wizardry
to Club Laga on Saturday.

The progressive bluegrass band out of south‘-
ern California —— comprised of guitarist Shawn
Watkins, fiddle player Sara Watkins and man-
dolin player Chris Thile — creates a sophisticat-
ed, alternative sound with traditional instru-
ments, an approach that rings true in old and
young fans alike.

The trio has been earning the respect of both
the mainstream music media and traditional
bluegrass authorities ever since its formation 13
years ago. Nickel Creek won a “Best
Contemporary Folk Album” Grammy, as well as
the “Emerging Artist of the Year” award at the
2000 International Bluegrass Music Awards.
Rolling Stone and Time have both noted the
band’s potential, while bluegrass stars like Bela
Fleck, Dolly Parton ‘and the Dixie Chicks have
elicited their help.

No small feats, especially considering the
group’s youth. Sean Watkin, at 26, is the oldest
in the band, with Chris Thile and Sara Watkins
both just 22. But don’t be misled by their ages —
all three of the members are undisputed virtu-

constitutional reforms and an
increased awareness of the drug prob-
lems of Ireland.
‘ The question the movie attempts
to answer is: why did Veronica
Guerin choose to act when others
remained silent? Was she extraordi-
narily brave? Reckless? Was she
afraid for the future safety of her own
child? Was she merely too stubborn to
back down? What motivates such an
individual to act without regard for
their own self—interest? Why was she
driven to change the world?
Unfortunately, the answer can’t
be found in director Joe1,Shumacher’s
(“Phone Booth”) version of the story.
While we gain from Cate Blanchett’s
performance a sense of Veronica as a
woman — we like her; she’s brave,
funny and loving —— there is no indi-
cation as to the motivating force that
drives her pursuit for truth and jus-
tice. While many aspects of her char-
acter seem to contribute to her moti-
vation, no single trait seems strong
enough to propel her to act as she
does. There is some bravery, compas-
sion and recklessness in each of us.
We, as viewers, Want to know what
made Guerin different; Schumacher
shows us how she was the same.
Blanchett (“Elizabeth”) turns in a
wonderful performance "as the title
character. Charismatic and elegant,
she allows us to see the many roles
played by Guerin and the precarious

balance between values and family
duties that led to her untimely death.
She is at once cocky and unsure, reck-
less and dedicated. Blanchett, with
perfect Dublin accent, charms the
audience and the characters on
screen.

Also strong are the portrayals of
criminals John Gilligan and John
Traynor by Gerard McSor1ey
(“Angela’s Ashes”) and Ciaran Hinds
(“Road to Perdition”), respectively.

. McSorley’s Gilligan is a drug—dealing
‘crime boss with a serious abhorrence
for the press. On the surface, the man
is quiet. But through McSorley’s por-
trayal of Gilligan’s violent spurts of
rage, the audience has no doubt that
he is a dangerous man. Traynor, on
the other hand, is more ambiguous —
his lust for fame leads him to be an
informant for Guerin. We meet him
first as a friend, and though we later
realize the questionable nature of that
friendship, Hinds’ performance
allows us to sympathize with him
throughout the film. Colin Farrell
also appears in a pointless, but enter-
taining, cameo as Tattooed Boy.

Superb acting powers this reality-
based drama, but it can’t help
Shumacher’s limited vision for the
story.

“Veronica Guerin” opens in theaters

9 of 12A Window to the
World

Oliver Chin

Frog Ltd.
2003

Since September 11, 2001, the
media has bombarded us with news
concerning its aftermath, including
the “war on terror.” But how many
of us truly have time to keep up with
every event in world politics that is,
or has been, affected by terrorism?
If only there were a way that all the
dense facts could be compacted into
a tiny ’— say, 100-page — book,
with cartoon-like illustrations and a
publication that resembles a comic
book.

Well, look no further. Oliver
Chin, author of “9 of 1: A Window
to the ‘World” offers an interesting
approach to an oversaturated topic.

He has created, a comic book that
lays out how each culture

.,-1;.

 

 

and nation

has been affected by terrorism. The
content of -the book goes; beyond
what type of relationship the United
States has ’ with other nations to
include information that Americans
have either chosen to forget or have
suppressed deep in their conscious-.
ness, such as our history of internal
terrorism, with individuals_ such as
Timothy Leary and Charles Manson.

3 This book is unique in its layout
and subject matter. Its content is
rich enough that it could be used as
a supplemental reading for a col-
lege-level world politics course, yet
short and direct enough to grab hold
of the attention of a young adult
who is unfamiliar with current
events. But the truly remarkable
trait of this book is the truths that it
leads us to face and how we are
allowed to face them — with a sense
of optimism and hope for positive
change.

Kinnard is a woman that rocks

Dawn Kinnard made a name for
herself around State College by play-
ing bars in that area with the band
Dusk to Dawn. Now she’s on her own,
and Pitt’s campus is her next target.

On her self—titled solo CD,
Kinnard puts her sometimes over-
whelmingly strong voice against a
backdrop of bluesy melodies to great
effect. All at once, she sounds like a
lovely combination of Lucinda
Williams, Sheryl Crow and pre-
“Intuition” Jewel.

On “Blue Rain,” Kinnard sings of
her lover escaping the monotonous life

and relationship they’re stuck in,

singing, “I just sit in my big hard lazy
chair/Cause I know why you’re run-
ning darling/And I don’t care/You got
this crazy dream you gotta follow to
the end/Yeah but what do you do when
you find there’s no end?”

The haunting guitar in “Wires in
the Sky” will send shivers up and
down your spine, as will Kinnard’s

- emotional lyrics. “And wires in the sky

shine so bright/I came here thinking I
could make things right/Everything I
do I see right through/Face shows any-

!" “"9"”-C 0'“  

thing I do/I’m guilty/I don’t know
why/Yeah I’m guilty/I don’t know
why.”

And on “Pictures,” Kinnard bares
her soul against a soft Wurlitzer and
moumfully strummed guitar. She sings
of a dying relationship in which the
man is alienating himself from his
lover, preparing to cut it off. She
evokes stark images in listeners’
minds, telling us, “Piles of pictures,
letters from you/It’s all so easy, impos-
sible to see through/Heard your foot-
steps down the stairs/Sit alone on the
couch, nobody cares/Your hair grows
wavy and long/T he last days were lost,
words of songs.”

Kinnard consistently uses her soul-
ful, blues—tinged voice and emotionally
driven lyrics to amazingly good effect.
When she comes to Pitt this Saturday,
prepare to be blown away by her com-
pelling voice and intense emotions.

Valetta Anderson teaches playwrights, opens play

Budding playwrights will get the
opportunity to work with accomplished
playwright Valetta Anderson this weekend.

On Sat., Oct. 18 from 1 to 3 p.m. in
room 3T0l WWPH, Anderson will be
conducting a free workshop that offers tips
to playwrights on how to develop scripts,
make their stories more compelling and
market their scripts without an agent.

A former professor of drama at
Spelrnan College, Valetta Anderson teach-
es play writing to high school students in
Atlanta, Ga. She is also a member of
Alternate ROOTS, an organization that
supports original art that is rooted in a par-
ticular community of place, tradition or
spirit.

After attending the workshop, stu-
dents have the opportunity to attend a per-
formance of Valetta Anderson’s play,
“She’ll Find Her Way Home” —, at their
own expense. The University’s Kuntu

Repertory Theatre opens its season with ,

Anderson’s play in the Seventh Floor
Auditorium of Alumni Hall. Established in
1974, the Kuntu Repertory Theatre is ded-
icated to examining black life from a
sociopolitical and historical perspective.
Directed by Kuntu’s founder and artistic
director Vemell Lillie, the play reﬂects this
season’s theme: roles that blacks played in
the development of the American West.
“She’ll Find Her Way_Home” is the
1870s, post-Civil War America love story

of Isaiah Montgomery and Martha Robb.
These two remarkable people were the
founders of the black city of Mound
Bayou, Miss. The cast includes Jessica
Burch, Rita -Gregory, Julian Hicks, Bria
Walker and Leo Beatty. This production
promises to give a compelling look at how
blacks helped -the growth of the West. -

Using a comic—book format,

Chin keenly utilizes a medium that
best explains cultural differences
around the world. We are presented

»with facts alongside a story of a-

group, of high school students in a

‘fictitious school given an assign-

mentto interview someone about
how they have been .affected’per-

‘ sonally and politically by the evéents
.of September 11, 2001. By placing

pictures of the cultural distinctions
alongside the text, the reader is
more able to ﬂow through the book

' — we can see what is being talked
about, rather than being forced to C

imagine it.
“9 of 1” is atypical because it

. does notwsimply place facts without
feeling. Instead, it forces the reader

to ponder over alternatives and
ways of change by asking questions

such as “How hard" is it to do the -
, right thing?” and “Would the out-

come of another war be different?”

i From a thorough introduction to
the conflict between Afghanistan
and Pakistan to American greed for’

‘oil and the repercussions it has

caused to the culture of the “glori-
fied” suicide bombers and martyrs,
“9 of 1” could help ‘enrich the lives
of young adults struggling to grasp
the concepts of what isgoing on in
the world. , _
Recommended for those who
are struggling to understand recent
events in America and the reasons
they happened, politically, econom-
ically and culturally, “9 of 1” offers
a perspective on ‘these topics unlike
any other media representation.

the Panthers’ 4-0 victory over Robert Morris

Senger scores hat trick in
Pitt’s 4-0 win over Colonials

JIM EIBEN
Staff Writer

The struggling Pitt women’s
soccer team got just what it needed
last night in the form of a non-con-
-ference game with ‘another team that
_has had its share of difficulties. ' .

Robert Morris’ Colonials (2-12)
made the short trip to Founders
Field and were defeated by the
Panthers, 4-O. Forward Cara Senger
led the way for Pitt, netting a hat
trick.

Pitt, (5-7-2 Overall, 1-1-1 Big
East), had only been able to muster
a single goal in the first four games
of its current home stand —— until
yesterday. “It’s nice to score some
goals,” head coach Sue-Moy Chin
said after the game.

Jennifer DeLaHoz started the
onslaught for the Panthers, scoring
her fourth goal of the season mid-
way through the first half. The
sophomore forward was able to

receive a pass and get behind the
Colonial defense before burying a
shot behind Robert Morris goal-
keeper Shana Berardi.

A few minutes later, Senger took
over. For her first goal, Senger stole
the ball off of a Colonialplayer and
raced down the middle of the field
with one defender to beat. Robert
Morris _ defender Jen Rodgers
bumped her, but Senger kept her
balance and was able to get a shot
off that trickled by Berardi.

Senger added her second goal in
the 11th minute of the second half.
Panthers defender Jacqueline Reuter
ﬂoated a’ shot ‘towards the net that
bounced around in front of Berardi
until Senger was able to clean up the
mess and score.

Pitt dominated the entire second
half, keeping the ball in Robert
Morris territory. Senger finished of
the scoring in the 26th minute, tak-
ing a free kick from forward Erin
Hills and putting it into the corner

of the net.

The game ended with a scare for
the Panthers, when back Jacqueline
Reuter went down with an ankle
injury in the closing minutes.
Although she needed to be helped
off the field, Sue-Moy Chinisounded
confident after the game that Reuter
would be ready to go on Sunday.

While the win won’t help the
Panthers in the Big East standings,
it may bring a new confidence to a
team that finishes its season with
three straight conference games.
Pitt, currently tied with Rutgers for
the final spot in the Big East tourna-
ment, will be in adogfight to quali-
fy for postseason play.

The Panthers are next in action,
on Sunday at l p.m., when they take
on Notre Dame. Chin seemed excit-
ed about the challenge of taking on
the Fighting Irish.

“Notre Dame is [ranked] second
in the nation,” Chin said. “What
more can you say?”

Fan did not
lose game
for Cubs

.  j,-S

   

Steve Bartman was just another
Cubs’ fan when he woke up on Tuesday
morning.

Bartman, 26, is a huge Cubs fan, but
his life changed in a split second. Many
people were preparing for the return of
the Cubs to the World Series for the first
time since 1945. Locker room attendants
were probably preparing the locker room
for the festivities that follow a playoff
series victory.

The champagne would have to be
put away after a disastrous inning. In the
top of the eighth inning during game six
of the National League Championship
Series, Florida Marlins’ second baseman
Luis Castillo came to the plate.

Chicago had its young ace Mark
Prior on the mound and a 3-0 lead going
into the inning.

This game was a lock. Right?

Castillo fouled a ball down the left
field line, and Cubs’ left ﬁelder Moises
Alou gave chase and attempted to make
a leaping catch at the wall in foul territo-
ry. It looked like Alou may have had a
play, but the ball deflected off Bartman
and fell foul into the seats.

Florida would go on to score eight
unanswered runs and send the series into
a pivotal game seven.

Chicago Cubs’ fans should be
ashamed of the way they treated
Bartman after the incident. Most
notably, Bartman was not the only fan
who attempted to catch the foul ball.
There were several fans pursuing the
ball. He just had the misfortune of being
the spectator who the ball hit.

This incident was not the deciding
factor in the game. Prior could have pro-
ceeded to get Castillo out, but he walked
him.

Also, Alex Gonzalez had an oppor-
tunity to end the inning when he mis-

Boston College will have rough time in ACC

Memo to Boston College: good-
bye, good riddance and good luck —
you’re going to need it.

With their plans to leave the Big
East, the Eagles have now become
the redheaded stepchild of the
Atlantic Coast Conference.

Just four months ago, the ACC
and its schools were wooing Boston
College to join the conference and
help create the opportunity to host a
football championship game that
would make millions of dollars for
not only the teams involved, but the
conference itself. .

But it didn’t happen. The ACC
invited Miami and Virginia Tech,
and, like the pimple—faced kid with
glasses looking for a date, Boston
College got rejected.

No problem. The Eagles were
still a member of the Big East and
now that they had been spurned,
there was no way they’d leave the
conference, right?

Wrong.

After the ACC couldn’t con-
vince Notre Dame to give up its
football independence and the
NCAA rejected its attempt to stage a
championship game with just 11
conference members —— rules state
that a conference must have 12

   

MAR   auws

  

teams to host a championship game
—- the ACC needed someone to fin-
ish its expansion.

When in need of an easy hook-
up, why not turn to the one who still
has a thing for you?

So Boston College jumped at the
opportunity to join the ACC, despite
having been involved in the Big
East’s discussions on how to save
the conference. 1

According to Boston College’s
president, the Rev. William Leahy,
the move will help the school finan-
cially and athletically, and will also
open up new places for the school to
recruit.

That should be difficult, consid-
ering what Boston College is facing.

One of the changes that the con-
ference and its schools’ presidents
decided on was to increase the exit
fee from $1 million to $5 million,

nurestrumr  ms was

which the Eagles will now have to
pay when they leave.

And that’s not the only financial
concern the Eagles will have.

Boston College’s closest confer-
ence opponents will be Virginia and
Virginia Tech, both of which are
more than a nine-hour drive from
Boston. Teams travel by either bus
or plane, depending on how far
away the destination is.

With those two schools that far
away by bus, it’s likely that Boston
College will have to send most of its
teams by plane, which costs more
the farther you go.

Granted, the ACC will put the
Eagles in a division that geographi-
cally makes the most sense‘, but that

,still means a lot of traveling and a
lot of plane tickets. And if that

means that the Eagles won’t'play
Florida State and Miami on a regu-
lar basis, I would imagine that
Boston College’s administration
would be upset by that.

Of course, if the Eagles can find
their way into the football champi-
onship game, then they won’t have
to worry as much about financial
problems. '

But that won’t happen.

Boston College will now go

from being in the upper echelon of
what would be left of the Big East
— which really isn’t saying much ——
to the bottom third of the ACC in
football and men’s basketball. Yeah,
its other sports will be competitive,
but they don’t bring in the money
like football and_ basketball. .
Miami, Florida State and
Virginia Tech are consistently
ranked in the top 25 in football, and

‘this year, all three are in the top 10.

Maryland, North Carolina State and
Virginia have all also been ranked at
some point this season, which is
more than Boston College can say.
The Eagles haven’t been ranked

since the end of the l999‘season,.

when they climbed as high as ‘No.
22. Before that, they hadn’t cracked

the top 25 since the first week of the ‘

1995 season, when they were also
ranked No. 22, and Boston College

hasn’t been in the top 10 since '

November of 1992.
The chances of the Eagles mak-
ing that conference championship

game and raking in the proceeds

from it aren’t good. _,
The same could be" said for
men’s basketball. Boston College

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

Justin Lowery is an architect on
and off the soccer field.

He sees the way things are
designed and develops new ways to
make them better. He applies his off-
field studies of architecture on the
field. _

Lowery, the sophomore goalkeep-
er for the Pitt men’s soccer team, has
always been a big fan of architecture.
When he was younger, his uncle
would buy ‘him '
model houses that
had ﬂoor plans
and designs to fol-

_them. — '

. “I’d take all
the pieces and
change it,”‘
Lowery said. He
would completely
alter the design
with the materials
provided, and put something original
together — something better, accord-
ing to him. ‘

Much the same can be said of
what Lowery is doing on the soccer
field. In his first year starting for the
Panthers, Lowery is beginning to take
the role of leader, as many goalkeep-
ers often do. '

“He takes a leadership role on the
field,” Panthers’ defender Jacob Kring

. said. “When people are down [Lowery

will] pick them up.”

 

Kring went on to explain that it is
not only what Lowery says to fellow
teammates, but also how he plays.

“[Lowery] makes everyone
relax,” midfielder Marco Carrizales
said. ,

Teammates will go to Lowery at
halftime for advice.

‘fl really understand the game,”
Lowery said. i

At the goalkeeper position,
Lowery has a great View of the field.
He can see the runs the strikers should
be making and he can see if his team

./ is not possessing
the ball enough.

He can also
_ see who is getting

caught too far up
the ﬁeld. Through
all these observa-
tions, he can tell
his teammates
exactly ' what
needs to be done

do what.

Lowery’s knowledge of play on
the field does not stem from his goal-
keeper observations alone. He has
played at the forward position before.
In fact, Lowery is still new to the
goalkeeper position. _

‘‘I’m still learning,” Lowery said.
“I know I can be a lot better [at] keep-
er.”

Lowery made the switch to goal-
keeper during his freshman year of

Cubs’ fans should be
ashamed of behavior
during game six

Nash, page 15

played a ball that had double play written
allover it. Instead, the ball popped out of
his glove, and the game was tied at three.

You want to talk about a play that
decided a game, Or, for that matter, a
series, look ‘at the American League
Championship Series in 1996, when 12-
year-old Jeffrey Maier reached Over the
right ﬁeld wall and took a deep ﬂy ball
off the bat of New ‘York Yankees’ short-
stop Derek Jeter away» from Baltimore
Orioles’ right fielder Tony Tarasco,
which -sent the game into extra innings.

Cubs’ fans have nothing to complain
about, because their beloved team pro-
ceeded to play sloppy baseball after the
missed opportunity.

Who is to say that Alou would have
caught the ball anyway?’ Bartman just
did what any’ normal spectator would
have done in his position. It’s not like he
pulled a Jeffrey Maier and reached into
the ﬁeld of play.

During the summer, I go to several

baseball games and have had seats as
close as a couple of rows from the ﬁeld.
I know that when a ball goes up in the air
and is drifting back towards me the ﬁrst
thing that goes through my mind is, “get
ready, that ball is coming towards me.”

I am hardly thinking about whether
or not a ﬁelder is attempting to make a
play. Since I am a student of the game, I
would hope that I would have checked
ﬁrst to see if a ﬁelder has a play on the
ball; that is, if my Orioles are out in the
ﬁeld trying to make a play.

But in all seriousness, I think that if

you put nine out of 10 people in the same
position, they would havemade the same
mistake. His mistake was not allowing
Alou to make the play and being ready to

' catch the ball in case the ball dropped in.

Dusty Baker and the Cubs handled
the situation with class by not bad-

mouthing him and simply saying

Bartman. must have been a Marlins’ fan.
But the Cubs’ fans acted almost as badly
as Cleveland Browns fans did in a game
in December 2001, whenthey threw beer
bottles at Ofﬁcials after a botched call.
Bartrnan probably feels as low as he

‘ as ever felt in his life, and it is shameful

that he had to be escorted out Of the sta-
dium by security after fans threatened

- him and threw beer containers and other

objects at him.

The poor guy even skipped work on
Wednesday. Leave him alone, because it
could have just as easily been one of us.

Kevin Nash is the assistant sports editor
for The Pitt News.

New ACC Opponents are superior to Boston College

Marchilena, page 16

has a hard enough time in the Big
East, and it will be hard to compete
with the ‘likes of Duke, North
Carolina and Wake Forest on the
court.

As for recruiting, it will give
Boston College more opportunities
to get players from Florida, North
Carolina and Virginia, but the
majority of athletes who are going
to choose to go to Boston are the
ones who are overlooked by Miami
and Florida State.

Who is going to choose to spend
the winter’ in Boston rather than

Miami?

Leahy can say that this move
makes sense for Boston College, but
it really doesn’t. Had Syracuse been
chosen to go with the Eagles, that
might have made a little more sense,
because both schools are in the
Northeast.

' With all of its new conference
opponents south of the Mason-
Dixon line — and superior to the
Eagles in the major revenue sports
—— this move doesn’t make sense for
Boston College.

As ‘for the ACC, this is a great
move because it can now have its
football championship game.

Why should the conference offi-
cials care that Boston College suf-
fers from this deal? Remember, the
Eagles are the jilted lover here.

So while Pitt, Syracuse and West
Virginia are at the top of the new
Big East also known as
Conference USA East -——— Boston
College will be spending plenty of
time in the ACC.’s cellar.

Joe Marchilena is the sports editor
for The Pitt News and he is going to
enjoy watching Pitt thrash Boston
College in two weeks. That is, if
Walt Harris can figure out which
plays will work.

Lowery learned from watching former Pitt goalkeeper Justin Gaul

Lowery, page 18

high school. His club team was getting ready to par-
ticipate in a tournament, and their starting goalkeep-
er came up with an injury before its start.

Lowery was fooling around with teammates,
and he acted as if he was goalie, stopping his team-
mate’s shots. His coach took notice of him and
asked him to play in net in place of their injured
starter. Lowery agreed, and he was eventually
named the MVP of the tournament as result of his
play in net.

Lowery continued to play the keeper position
for his club team, while playing forward for his high
school team. In his final two years at Paideia
School, he recorded 54 goals and 41 assists at the
forward position.

“I just love soccer,” Lowery said. “I wouldn’t
play any other sport.”

He said he wouldn’t, but he has. Lowery was a
wide receiver and a safety for his high school foot-
ball team.nHe was also a key player on his high
school’s basketball team. Lowery hit a three pointer
to win the game in the ﬁnals of the regional cham-,
pionship.

Lowery isalways looking to make the big play.
He is very competitive and will do anything to win.
“I hate to lose in anything I do,” ‘he said. He plays
video games with Carrizales and Kring.

“If I lose, I just sit there,” Lowery said.

Lowery reﬂects over losses and looks to build
on what he has learned, so the mistakes he made do
not happen again. After games, he likes to go to his
home in.Oakland, where he lives by himself. He

"Clown Prince of Pocket
Billiafds”  

goesover all the positives and the negatives in the
game.
Lowery watches not only his game tapes, but

also any soccer game he can get his hands on. He"

subscribes to Fox Sports World from his cable
provider, and watches many international soccer
games. .

“I learn from every game I watch,” Lowery said.

Lowery especially likes watching Tim Howard.

of Manchester United. ,-
‘ ,“He’s a great keeper,” he said. “He just stepped
up and made a name for himself.”

Tim Howard has made an instant impact with
Manchester United, recording four shutouts in seven
matches. Lowery, likewise, has made an instant
impact for the Panthers. ’ /

His first collegiate start was a 1-0 win over

nationally ranked Boston College, and h I

he has gone on to add two lmore
shutouts as the season has progressed.

Another goalkeeper Lowery has
been able to watch and learn fromjwas
longtime Panthers’ starter Justin Gaul,
whom Lowery replaced.

Kirk Brodows, the assistant coach,
had Lowery watch Gaul all last year.
Lowery learned from Gaul’s tech-
niques. Heleamed what to do in cer-
tain situations, by watching the steps
he would take and where he’d put his
hands. ' ‘ -

With the knowledge Lowery is
gaining from hard work on and off the
practice field, he is showing that there
is a promising future for Pitt soccer.

Luxbapher said, “He’s got great poten-
tial, and he’s getting more confi-
dence.” .

Lowery says the main thing he
reminds himself of on thefield is to
remember ‘what Brodows tells him.
“Stay up, read the play, pick up the
head on breakaways.’’

’ \ Eleven of their 13 contests this sea-

son have been one-goal . games.
Lowery believes the Panthers can still
turn their season‘ around this year,
since they are a young team and have
many young players who are stepping
up- I .

Even so, with a young team, the
Panthers have a promising future
because of the number of starters
returning next year. Lowery has two
years left, and he wants tostep up just
