And then there was one.

After the city’s two alternative papers,
InPittsburgh and Pittsburgh City Paper,
competed for years the struggle is over.
Last week, the president of Philadelphia-

based Review Publishing, Anthony‘

Clifton, sold InPittsburgh to Steel City
Media, which owns Pittsburgh City Paper
as well as radio stations WRRK 97 and
WLTJ Lite FM.

As of Sept. 27, when the sale took
place, publication of InPittsburgh ceased
and all employees were immediately ter-
minated. _

‘ According to Stephen Segal, the for-
mer editor of InPittsburgh,- all interested
employees will have the opportunity to

A interview for a job with Steel City Media.

Segal said that while he understood that
the paper had not been proﬁtable for some
time, the deal surprised him. i

“Certainly none of us were expecting
this to happen this way,” he said. His main
concern is for the future of the paper’s
readership.

“I hope that Steel City Media realizes
what a serious responsibility they’ve

taken on now as the only alternative
weekly in the city,” he said. ‘The City
Paper will have to spend thought and
money on how to incorporate as much of
the InPittsburgh editorial content as possi-
ble in order to continue serving the
Pittsburgh readership in the way it
deserves. I feel sad "for the city to lose a
newspaper that’s been a dynamic voice
here for 17 years.”

Andy Newman, the editor of City
Paper, stated that he would do his best to
incorporate InPittsburgh’s strong points.

“ I have a potentially bigger talent
pool and a bigger readership,” Newman
said. “I need to make a paper that reﬂects
those things.”

But Newman expressed a conﬂict
with this goal.

“I also like the paper that we’re mak-

ing and I’m not going on a rampage in my

own shop,” he said.
Newman has witnessed the death of a
paper before. He said that he has worked
for ﬁve papers, all of which have shut
down. '
When Review Publishing pur-
chased InPittsburgh in
Newman was the editor and the com-
pany fired him. He had to collect his

1997, 

belongings and leave within a few hours.’

“I went over [to InPittsburgh’s ofﬁce]
on Friday to see if anybody wanted to talk
with me,” he said. “It was weird. Last time
I was there,_ I was leaving with all my stuff
in a box.”

He said that though the two papers
were rivals, he felt no sense. of victory at
InPittsburgh’s closing.

“I found the whole thing to be a very
sad occasion,” he said. “It’s been a very
competitive enviromnent. In some
ways, you feel like you’re ﬁghting
to the death. But then when the
other guy dies, you feel a sense
of mourning instead of a
sense of winning,”  _
Newman said. "

Colombian journalist risks
his life for country’s future

STEPHANIE MEYER/STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER
Ignacio Gomez, a journalist whose work in Colombia has
uncovered scandals and won awards, spoke last night in
the William Pitt Union.

JAMES DEWEESE
' Staff Writer

Members of the intemational business community -
ﬁom Coca-Cola to British Petroleum Co. Ltd — play a
fundamental role in perpetuating the violence that has
plagued Colombia for decades, according to Ignacio
Gomez. . '

In a lecture at the William Pitt Union yesterday,

‘ ‘Gomez, the winner of Amnesty International’s 2000

Journalist Under Threat Award, said one of these corpora-

. tions has resorted to funding private mercenaries to protect

its economic interests.

“When they think about oil, they also think about pro-
tection for those pipelines,” Gomez said, alluding to the
results of one of his most recent investigations linking
members of the British intelligence community, BP and.
right-wing paramilitary groups.

According to Gonzalez, left-wing guerillas frequently
charge revolutionary taxes on products such as coca leaf

p that originate or pass through areas they control. Of greater

concern to BP the guerilla groups also often demand a fee
in exchange for not sabotaging oil pipelines.

Rather than paying the revolutionary fees, which have
attained a sort of de facto legitimacy, Gonzalez said BP

. frmded and trained members of the right-wing paramilitary

groups to protect the pipelines, thereby encomaging further
armed conﬂict in a country ravaged by years of war.
Gonzalez described a country where legal institutions
are nominally “nice,” but where the political realty is con-
siderably bleaker. .
“Democracy doesn’t exist,” Gonzalez said, making
reference to the violent political and geographical divisions
that exist between the paramilitary, guerilla, drug and inter-
national interests. '
According to Gonzalez, those internal divisions, fur-
ther complicated by outside interventions, have made vio-
lence the leading cause of death in the Colombia. And jour-

Pan-Hellenic Council stresses
community involvement

JUSTIN MCCLELLAND
Staff Writer

A For Tamira Howard, being in a
sorority isn’t about al1—night keggers
or wild step dances. It’s about a fam-
ily, 250,000 strong.

“Belonging to a sorority forms a
unique bond,” said Howard, presi-
dent of Pitt’s chapter of the National
Pan-Hellenic Council. .“I can barely
speak on it, it’s just so tremendously
profound. We provide a support sys-
tem that keeps all of us grounded. We
unify as one.”

Dozens of other loyal fraternity
and sorority members echoed
Howard’s sentiments when they
spoke last night at a Meet the Greeks
forum in the William Pitt Union.

The National Pan-Hellenic
Council was formed in 1930 to coor-
dinate eight historically black frater-
nities and sorori-
ties. The national
number has since
grown to nine,
and last ‘night
was a chance for
Pitt’s seven pre-
dominantly black

“We want to see
you at all of our

freshman Nikki Weyant.

Weyant said she came to the
Meet the Greek function to learn the
basic facts and to see if being in a
sorority would be worth her time.

“At home, I was in a youth soror-
ity, but I want to see what the real"
thing’s like before I commit,”
Weyant said before the formal
demonstrations.

Each fraternity and sorority gave
a formal speech detailing the organi-
zation’s history and principle values.
Some wowed the audience by nam-
ing all of their founding father or
mothers while others simply gave a
founding date and place.

Each organization focused pri-
marily on their charitable events such
as blood drives, toy collections and
participation in projects with groups
like Habitat for Humanity. '

Nathan James, spokesman for Phi

Beta Sigma, said, '

“We don’t want
to see you just at
social functions,
we want to see"
you at all of our
events, helping
the community.”

The organi-

time to defend

reckless partying and debauchery.

“Joining Alpha Phi Alpha got my
mental functioning right,” said Daryl
Patterson, a junior majoring in mar-
keting. “A lot of fraternities, it’_s all
physical involvement. Our fraternity’
is about overcoming mental obsta-
cles.”

Patterson also took pride in the
symbolism a fraternity carries with
it. “Look at all these tables and col-
ors,” he said, motioning across the
room. Seven tables were decked out
with bright banners in a variety of
colors. Many displayed pictures of
prominent members, special events
and functions.

For some of the students explor-
ing the possibility of joining, it was a
bit overwhelming. “I’m not sure if I
want to join a sorority" yet,” said

fraternity to rush.

“Meet the

Greeks is a good

catalyst for stu-

dents wondering what Greek life is

about and a good way to put our _

organizations out there, Howard
said. “But possible members need to
talk individually with members and
do community service with a’frater-
nity or sorority to see what they actu-
ally do in real life. Then they’ll know
if it’s worth their time to join.”

Weyant was impressed by the '

function but taking Howard’s words
to heart she remained uncommitted
about whether to join a sorority.

“I was very pleased to see how
community service-oriented most of
the sororities are,” Weyant said.

“I knew a lot of the facts, but see-
ing howlarge a part they take in the
community makes me feel better
about them. I like to volunteer "a lot. I
have to say I’m thinking more
strongly now than ever about joining

Pitt Arts offers Cheap Seats and Oakland escape

ZEANNE HESTERMAN
The Pitt News

While thousands of Pitt students
cheered for the Panthers at Heinz
Field Thursday night, a dozen stu-
dents’ led by the Pitt Arts Program
.enjoyed an alternative way of getting
involved. The Pitt Arts program
sponsored a Thursday night trip to
see “The Clearing,” currently run-
ning at City Theater on the South

Matthew Clearfield chose to go
to the play instead of the game."

“I’ve always loved the theater.
It’s exciting,” he said. “I’ll get tickets
to see pretty much anything they’ll

offer because it is a wonderful oppor-

tunity. I mean, why not? It’s free.”
V Garland Waleko, a freshman from
Ohio, also attended the performance.

. “There is so much more ‘culture here.

This is like half of my education
right here,” she said.

Helen Edmundson’s “The
Clearing” is set in mid-17th century
Ireland when Cromwell’s English
army ousted the Irish king and estab-
lished a Protestant government. The
story follows one couple’s struggle to
stay together while the politics of

‘ their time threaten to tear them apart.

The play will run through Oct. 7.

Not only did the students get to
enjoy the historica1ly—based perfor-
mance, but they also got to meet the
actors following the play, courtesy of
Pitt Arts. 2

Jeannine Foster—McKelvia, the
director of communication relations
at City Theater, helped organize the
meeting.

“It is important because this is
the next generation of theater—goers.
After all, the arts are the keepers of
the culture,” she said.

Pitt Arts often organizes such
interactive opportunities around per-
formances in order to provide the stu-

dent‘ with a comprehensive educa-
tional experience.

Jen Saffron, coordinator of the
Pitt Arts program stressed that her
office is interested in student cus-
tomer satisfaction.

“We are a community of learners,
so we want to be able to offer an inte-
grated approach for our students to
be able to access the arts organiza-
tions,” she said. “I am interested in
students coming here and having an

experience of value.”

In the private question-and-
answer session, the actors talked
about the audience’s reaction to the
play based on the present state of the
nation. Kathleen O’Grady, who

spoke about the play’s timeliness. ‘

“Let’s face it, this wasn’t the
feel—good play of the year before
what happened two weeks ago,” she
said. “I .think what is going on with
the country has allowed this play to
be seen with different eyes. It res-
onates, especially now.”

The Pitt Arts offers organized
trips like the one Clearfield and
Waleko took, but they also offer a do-
it-yourself program called Cheap
Seats. * D P‘ ' ‘

“It- -is- set up~'t'o‘ be a self—serve

can show up anytime the Union is
open and simply follow directions to
reserve seats.”

The Pitt Arts office is located in
room 929 of the William Pitt Union.
There are seven boxes on the wall
outside the office, one for each of the
organizations involved in the Cheap
program. These include
Pittsburgh Public Theater, Pittsburgh
Dance Council, Pittsburgh "Ballet
Theater, Pittsburgh Symphony,
Pittsburgh Opera, Pittsburgh

Chamber Music Society and the
Renaissance and*Baroque Society.
To use the Cheap Seat Program,
students must fill out the form mid-
week before the performance they

wish to see, drop it in the box, and
pick up the reserved "ticket at. the
venue box office prior to the perfor-
mance. «

Workshop on global justice

focuses on Afghanistan

GREG HELLER-LABELLE
Staff Writer

Students in Solidarity and the Thomas
Merton Center hosted a workshop this
weekend on terrorism and its effects on the
global economy.

About 100 people attended the work-
shop, entitled ‘Terrorism & Globalization:
The Need for Global ‘Justice in the Shadow
of War.”

The event featured several keynote
speakers including Pitt professor of econom-
ics Mark Ginsberg, who spoke about the
International Monetary Fund and its policies

. of semantics.

“I checked my calendar,” Gingsberg
said. “It’s not 1984, but we still ﬁnd words.”

Ginsberg referred to the policy of ‘flabor
ﬂexibility,” a condition included in many
IMF loans that allows employers to circum-
vent some labor union’s workers’ protection.

“It won’t be too far of a stretch, I think,”
Ginsberg said, “to see labor as terrorist orga-
nizations that can be targeted by their own
govemment.” _ .

Another speaker was Lisa Valanti, pres-
ident of the Cuba—America Sister Cities
Commission. Valanti’s speech, titled
‘Terrorism and Globalization” focused on
the actions of the United States in the name
of all of its

Gonzalez began working as director of
investigations at E1 Espectador, Colombia’s
oldest newspaper, in 1986. Three months
after his arrival, assassins killed ﬂue paper’s
managing editor.

Since then,  and guerillas
alike have killed 17 of E1 Espectador’s
employees. Other papers, according to
Gonzalez, have not escaped a similar fate.

“One-hundred and sixty-two [journal-
ists have been] killed because of their duty,”
Gonzalez said, alluding to the role he said
journalism will play in the country’s future.

“If we don’t have freedom of expres-
sion, we don’t have the tools to defend
other human rights,” Gonzalez said. But, he
said, “It’s really hard to raise that’con- I
sciousness in Colombia because everyone
can be kill ”

U.S. policy toward Colombia doesn’t
help, he said

Mapiripan, a small Colombian village,
witnessed what Gonzalez referred to as
“one of the most cruel events in the recent
history of the country.” ‘

which had indirectly received training from

the ‘we’ that is the bottom of the rubble of
the World Trade Center? Because there were
50 nationalities of people victimized by that
attack.”

_ A common thread among the speakers
was concern over America’s role in man
conﬂicts overseas. -

“People say I’m anti-America because I
raise the issue of complicity,” Valanti said. “I
wouldn’t be here if I were anti-American.”

Afghan-American Dr. Muhammad
Sidki was the workshop’s main speaker.
Sidki, who earned a graduate degree in inter-
national affairs from Pitt, spoke about

, Islamic ftmdamentalism and the recent his-

tory of Afghanistan.

“Is this situation in Afghanistan a civil
war,” Sidki asked, “or a situation of foreign
occupation.”

Sidki gave a brief summary of the

V geopolitical reasons for the current problems

inAfghanistan, which at ﬁve million, has the
“largest population of refugees in the
world.” _ . _
Many of those problems, Sidki said,
will not stop as long as the United States
continues working with the Pakistani intelli-
gence, which put the Taliban in power.
“Imagine the FBI worldng with Al
Capone to help get the other gangsters- in
Chicago,” Sidki said. V —

U.S. military forces, massacred more than
69 people “to teach the town a lesson for ,
paying .taxes to the [left—wing] guerillas.” ,
The Carter administration enacted a
prohibition against providing military aid to
countries with documented human rights
violations, such as Colombia. But Gonzalez

. said the prohibition did not prevent U.S.

Special Forces from carrying out on-site
training exercises in Colombia that
Colombian national military forces hap-
pcned to witness.

Gonzalez outlined a chain of military

  training that ultimately placed U.S. military

techniques in the hands of right-wing para- ’
Gonzalez said that as part of the cur-

rent U.S. policy toward Colombia,
Colombian special forces receive counter-
insurgency training eight times a year. _
These forces then share their expertise with

the  groups.

Despite threats from paramilitaries,
guerillas and conupt politicians that have
forced him to ﬂee Colombia six times,
Gonzalez said he has never contemplated
giving up.

“I simply realized that there was ter-
ror,” he said. “A lot of my ﬁiends got
killed, but I’ll keep going.”

paper had not become economically self-
supporting,” according to the release.
The release also mentioned that after
years of investing in the paper, its unprof-
itable turnout and the current business cli-
mate indicated that it was time to sell.
But Segal said he feels that the sale
had tenible timing, since the paper recent-
ly began to improve its coverage. After
the Sept. 11 attacks, InPittsburgh pub-
lished daily news coverage on its Web
site, the ﬁrst action of its kind for the
paper and a rarity for a weekly paper.
“We thought it was important,” Segal
said. “We thought the community would
beneﬁt. We thought it was the right thing
to do. So obviously what saddens me the
most abut this sale is the timing of it. Our
work was possibly at its most important
pointever.”
Students also expressed disappoint-

ment because of the paper’s demise.

‘.‘Darrm it. I liked both of them,” said
freshman Ashley Hanson. “I make col-
lages and I used to cut stuff out and now I

“That sucks,” freshman Dave
Fuhnnan said. “It’s really important for
there to be independent newspapers what
with the manipulation of media; we don’t
get true representations of what actually
happens. Not that we did with the
InPittsburgh, but it was an alternative
voice,” he said.

“I_ enjoyed the InPittsburgh. I felt it
was more cultural and more focused on

college students and youth because it _

included articles they can relate to better,”
said Kalyn Brault, a freshman.

“This isn’t a business story. This is
not a simple transaction. A paper that has
had various impacts on the culture of the
city is gone. A voice has been stiﬂed,” he
said. But he does concede that money was
the cause of the sale.

‘This is the capitalist world. This is
how it works until we have the revolution
and power is restored to workers,” he said.

Only one alternativeremains

The newspaper wars hit the altema-
t:ive media on Sept. 27.

While they raged for years among’
mainstream media, they did not hit
Pittsburgh’s alternative media until last
Thursday. Pittsburgh, a relatively small
metropolitan area, had two alternatives:
InPittsburgh and City Paper.

That’s right, had, not has.

On Thursday, Review Publishing sold
InPittsburgh to Steel City Media, which
owns City Paper —— and radio stations
WLTJ and WRRK. InPittsburgh ceased
publication immediately.

Now Pittsburgh has only one altema-
tive paper. We will sorely miss the com-
petition as well as InPittsburgh itself.

Through its 17 years of existence,
InPittsburgh gained a reputation for its

‘ quality entertainment content as well as its

news coverage.

Writing was always InPittsburgh’s
first priority. Unlike City Paper, content
never seemed secondary to advertising.

In the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks,
InPittsburgh did something amazing and
rare for weekly papers: it went to daily
online publication, bringing readers new
content all week, including firsthand
accounts of the tragedy in New York.

So, now City Paper must try to woo
InPittsburgh readers. While a- daunting
task, it can be done —— especially if City
Paper chooses to incorporate some of

InPittsburgh’s ﬁner qualities.

It should improve its layout by taking
tips from InPittsburgh, which had a more
pleasing graphic design.

It should make better use of color -
even its fashion spreads are black and
white.

It should also move its “photo of the
wee ” from the beginning to the end of
the paper and stop running its blown-up
fake letter. People just don’t like to read

‘ that.

It is unfortrmate that a medium that
sprimg up in response to corporate con-
glomerates would fall victim to them.

What is even more unfortunate in this
case is that we’re now left with one alter-
native medium, a medium whose cover-
age of music we may ﬁnd difficult to trust
since its parent company also owns two
radio stations. -

-But important as this may be, the
question on many readers’ minds is: When
do we get our Savage Love again?
InPittsburgh published this kinky and
hilarious syndicated love column weekly,
and we can only hope City Paper will take
it up.

Although large corporations owned
both City Paper and InPittsburgh, we at
least had a choice between them. Now we
don’t. - .

And InPittsburgh didn’t even get a
chance to say goodbye.

A princess waiting for her prince:

Unbecoming of a feminist?  

I have a confession to make.
Does anyone remember my rant last
week about equality and indepen-
dence? As much as I believe pas-
sionately in everything I wrote, I
have to admit that at times I’m as
much of a helpless girl as

ing Jason my car keys. By some
miracle, there was a spare tire in my
trunk and using the jack he had in
his truck (because I didn’t have one)
Jason put it on my car. _i

When I came home I called my
boyfriend to complain,

Scarlett O’Hara.

A few weeks ago
when I was at work, a
customer came in and
said, “Do any of you drive
that silver Honda out
there?” He was referring
to my car and my first
thought was that he was
going to tell .me he rear-
ended my cute little

knowing full well that he
would- volunteer to get
new tires put on my car
for me. I handed over my
car keys again and two
days later I had brand
new rear tires without
ever having to go near a
garage -or a mechanic.
At this point you
could say, “Isn’t inde-

Civic. Instead he said,
“Well, it has a ﬂat tire.”
Instantly my heart sank. I have

no idea how to change a ﬂat tire. I’

can pump gas and remember when
to get my oil changed, but that’s
about it.

While trying not to anic, I wor-

ried if I would still be able to drive
back to-school in time for my 10
a.m. class. If left to my own devices,
I would have been limping down
Interstate 279 with a ﬂat’ tire in
rush-hour traffic. What made it even
worse ‘was that I was working with
three guys at the time and felt com-
pletely inept for not knowing what
to do. .

My friend Jason asked if I had
AAA. Of course I don’t. I didn’t

even know if I had a spare tire in my '

trunk, much less how to put it on.
So the story ends with me acting
like a damsel in distress and hand-

pendence a crucial part
of feminism? Shouldn’t you want to
be able to take care of things for
yourself?”

And you have a". point. The

princess waiting for her prince is-

pretty unbecoming for a woman who
claims to be a feminist.

So I made .a new resolutiongl
will stop being such a helpless girl
and learn how to do things for

myself. I decided I should not own’

anything I don’t‘ know how to fix;
I put my plan into action when
the gas range in my apartment sud-

idenly stopped working. I heard

there was some mysterious thing
called a “pilot light” involved and
that it “could go out and would need‘
to be relit. But of course I had no
idea where I could find this pilot"
light, or if it really even existed at

’ _ was less than interested to
hear the details. But when
someone told me hewas

responded that most: of the

guys here are too ugly. 1
Being a guy, I can’t make that kind of
judgment call, but apparently the

"majority of girls think this way too. If
.they lowered their standards a notch or

two on the sexual attractiveness scale,
then I think we’d all be having a lot
more sex.

Guys, on the other hand, are main-
ly just a bunch of sissies and unneces-
sarily miss out on tons of hot action:
When I asked a group of sophomore
guys living on campus why they
haven’t scored in a long time, the main
response was that they were too scared
to get shot down if they asked a hot
girl for sex.

I’m hoping this survey will bring
light to this devastating situation and
cause a lot more people to hook up. So
now that we know both girls and guys

,want it, it’s just a simple matter of

guys getting enough balls to ask the

' V '. involved in.a— sexualinci-
dent iinvolving urination, a ~ small
crowd "started to: form around ' him,
waiting-for every raunchyvdetail.

Students need to spice uptheir sex
lives. I’m obviously not an expert on
the matter or a sexual therapist. But I
have closely watched every episode of
HBO’s “Real Sex” series, and there-
fore consider myself at least highly
knowledgeable on the topic. ’

While talking to students, I heard
countless tales of boring two-minute
oral sex or standard position sex. What
I expect to hear from here on out is
how your boyfriend started talking
dirty to you during sex or how some
girl slapped your ass and told you to
call her mistress.

A lot of religious types feel shut
out of the sex game for the obvious
reason that they want to wait until they

get married. That is totally under- V

Study finds students are under-sexed

standable honorable.'But my ques-
tion is how long must you wait until

‘ you get married? In our parents’ days

it was common to be engaged by the
age of 20. Now it’s typical to wait
until 27 or maybe even 30 to start
looking. I think we need to have alot
more church mixers and pour a bottle
of Jack Daniel’s into the punch so
these religious kids can start getting it
on. -
A lot of fat people are ‘probably
reading this and feeling sad and lonely
— except for that entire chocolate
cake you just ate. But I have a solution
for you too. I’m here to help everyone.
Simply make‘ the connection with
someone like yourself. There is no
need to pull yourself off the sexual
market just because you may be “big-
gie-sized.” Be proud of yourself and
boost your confidence. Next time you
see someone your own size, shoot him
or her that buffet—eating, sex-hungry
look and see if he or she shoots you
oneback. I bet he or she will.
I sincerely hope all Pitt students
take this advice to heart.‘ Next week-

end I’m hoping to see a lot more smil— '

ing faces on Forbes Avenue. But
remember, safe sex is ‘always the way
to go. .

Besides, I have a lot of stock in a
condom company and I’m hoping to

cash in on it while you’re, all having

the best sex .of your lives.

all.

So I did exactly what you would
expect: I called my boyfriend. He
confirmed my pilot light theory‘ and
said it would be easy to relight. “I’ll
do it for you when I come over
later,” he said.

But at this point I remembered
my resolution. '

“Just tell me how to do it,” I
said. “I’ll figure it out.” p

And I did. It is exceptionally
easy. About two minutes and one
kitchen match later, I again had a
working stove. I was a happy and
newly empowered girl.

I continued my quest at work on
Sunday. Every time the register runs
out of tape, I have to ask someone

else to change it for me. Then I
stand there in front of a customer
like a moron and wait for help. It’s a
complicated procedure: It requires
about as much manual dexterity as
putting paper in a dot-matrix printer
— about none. V’  7_j _ -

When my register ran_':-‘out’ of

paper instead of standing there help- '

lessly while I waited for my goofy
assistant manager to quit talking
about “The Breakfast Club” long
enough to come help me, I decided
to figure it out myself. I opened up
the printer and started poking at the
empty register tape roll. Even
though I had watched other people
change it millions of times, I had no
idea what to do.

I had to call my assistant manag-
er "over after all. He watched me

fumble with the register tape and a
couple minutes later, I finally had a
working register again. Victory
number two for a former damsel in
distress-.

_ The lesson is that learning how
to ‘do all-Jr-‘the basic things I have
aliwaysmade guys take care of for
me isn’t hard after all. Next thing
you know, I’ll be changing my own
oil and talking about carburetors and
spark plugs. Or maybe I’ll just try to
figure out what a car jack looks like."

If you ever see Nancy Reddy stand-
ing by the side of a highway next to
a car with ‘smoke coming from its
hood, make sure not to help her.
She ’s determined to be independent,
even if that means figuring out what
a “transmission ’.’ is.

Get with the program:

I am stunned after reading
Heather Bowlan’s myopic take on
female relations in the 21st centu-
ry (“Why are girls so afraid to be
friends?,” Sept. 28). I presumed, '

falsely, that the notion of the “evil” - / A

patriarchal subjugation of I women

' popular in the ‘80s was a thing of

the past.,I am saddened to learn
this is not the case. It is‘ ludicrous
to think that there are women still

.-around who choose to take no

responsibility for their lack of '

humanity and compassion regard- ‘

ing others. It is equally appalling
that this writer would deign to

compare the plight of women with A

issues of civil war in Africa.

Give me , a , break. In my,
department I am the ‘minority, a
white man. The women in my
highly competitive department do
not resort to the tactics to which
Ms. Bowlan alludes. I am bafﬂed
when each day I am confronted
with more options for women to
have programs and magazines
extolling the virtues of “woman-
hood.” That said, “Why don’t
women form nurturing relation-
ships and support each other?” \

It’s simple: This is not, a
woman problem it’s a cultural
problem. An “us against them”
mentality only foments the old
need to have an “oppressor.” Take
personal responsibility Ms.
Bowlan — this is your problem,
not the system’s. Your commen-
tary could have earned high marks
were it not for your fallacious use
of logic. Simply put, it’s not a guy
or a girl thing, it’s an individually
human thing. Get with the pro-
gram.

Moutaineers ready to host Hokies

After a one-week layoff Big
‘Ea-st football was back this past

weekend. During yesterday’s Big

East coaches’ teleconference coach-
es addressed many issues including
the layoff, which was as much as
two weeks for some teams. Some
‘coaches were upset with their

teams’ sloppy play’ after the layoff.
Each was keyed up about their

games this week, three of ‘which
will be conference games.

West Virginia looks to upset
Virginia Tech in Morgantown
West Virginia (2-2, 0-1 Big
East) is coming off a disappointing
loss to Maryland and looks to beat

“for the first time since 1997, when
they defeated the Hokies 30-17.

Coach Rich Rodriguez’s main
focus for this week may be getting
his offense prepared for a Virginia
Tech defense that leads the Big East
in scoring defense (6.0 points
allowed per game), rushing defense

is one of the guys that needs to step
up,” Rodriguez said.

Outstanding Mountaineer line-
backer Grant Wiley is coming off an
injury but still managed to play well
last week. “[Wiley] played 50 plays
last Saturday -and

(41.0 yards per
game), pass defense
(134.8 ypg),: and
total defense (175.8
YPg)-

Rodriguez said,
“I watched them on
film and I think they
have one of -the top

 

we only expected

to 45 plays out of
him this week it
will be a bonus,”
Rodriguez said.
Wiley’s aggressive
style of play will be

Virginia Tech coach Fran

Beamer commented on West

Virginia’s excellent pass defense. “I

on offense,‘ you’ve got the best
receiver in the conference in Brown
and then you’ve got Cobourne aver-
aging 140 yards on the ground.”

Last season when the two teams
met Virginia Tech hammered West
Virginia 48-20.

In that game Hokie flanker
Andre Davis scored three touch-
downs. Of the Hokies 48 points, 41
were scored in the second half.
Saturday’s contest will be televised
at noon on ESPN2.

Syracuse travels to Rutgers to
take on the Scarlet Knights

Syracuse coach Paul Pasqualoni
quickly shut down any rumors that
quarterback Troy Nunes would start

Bizarre battles take form in Goldman’s head

‘ My sports psyche is going wild.
Each week, I make my picks on 10 col-
lege football games, and this week, I
decided to’ make a few matchups of my
own, as well as going over a few games
from the past weekend.

Kevan Barlow vs. Curtis Martin

This week’s Monday Night Football
game featured two fonner Pitt running
backs. Barlow became San Francisco’s
starting running back after Garrison
Hearst went down with a concussion.

Martin is one of the premier running
backs in the National Football League,
and Kevan Barlow is making himself
known throughout the NFL. It’s nice to
see players from Pitt, not only appearing
in the NFL, but on Monday Night
Football, and against each other nonethe-
less.

John Kruk vs. Soccer

I’m sorry + this is kind of bad —
but this matchup is a tie because both
sides play with one ball.

 Pitt vs. Miami

OY!

Michael Jordan vs. Mario Lemieux

This is my opportunity to apologize
to Lernieux for being incorrect about his
return to the NHL. But I still hate the fact
that Lernieux is risking ending his career
now with a points per game average less
than 2.0.

As for “His Airness,” I’m a Wizards
fan so I love the fact that my team might
be competitive this year, but Mike, come
on. Why throw away a perfect way to
end a career? I know that this return will
bring fans to NBA games, especially
Wizards games. I know Jordan will still
be the best player in the league, and the
Wizards might be good, but why risk it?

I do respect the fact that for the first
time in the history of sports the best
player wants to help a troubled franchise.
For that — sorry Pens fans —,Jordan gets
the nod in this matchup.

Penn State vs. Notre Dame

I know this game isn’t going to hap-
pen, but I-had to ﬁnd some way to men-
tion that Penn’ State is 0-4, and Joe
Paterno can’t match Bear Bryant’s pres-
tigious all-time wining record. Notre
Dame is going to be a hungry team when
Pitt goes to South Bend this weekend.

Notre Dame and Penn State a com-
bined 0-7 is hard to imagine, but it’s true.
In this matchup, the obvious winner is
Notre Dame since Penn State will at
least go 0-8 before winning a game this
year.

Cal Ripken vs. the world

This is me bitching that I had tickets
to Cal Ripken’s last home game, which
was supposed to be Sept. 23.
But because of the tragedies
of Sept. 11, his last home
game is now Oct. 6 and I
don’t have tickets.

For Ripken, on the other
hand, he was supposed to
ﬁnish in New York and not at
home which I knowhe didn’t
like. Then, after the
tragedies, the last game was

- scheduled at home, which

probably made Ripken
happy. Then, on Sunday, the

 

Sports Vlzw

Brian Goldman

I don’t see anything bright in their future.

Unfortunately, the winner of this game .-

will be the Cowboys because any team
that cuts Jeff George to sign Kent
Graham deserves to lose.

Barry Bonds vs. Mark McGwire

Barry Bonds is going to hit 70 home
runs. Then he is going to ﬁnish the sea-
son with 75 home runs, shattering
McGwire’s record. Ban'y Bonds is the
best player in baseball right now. He can
hit for average and power. He can steal
bases, score runs, take a record number
of walks and he can ﬁeld.

Meanwhile, McGwire, going into
yesterday’s games, was six for his last
31, with ﬁve of those hits being home

_ runs. He ishitting under .200 and can’t

do anything but put the ball
out of the park every now
and then. I’m not the
"biggest Barry Bonds fan,
but he is the no-brainer in
this matchup. '

Pat Meares vs. Lloyd
McClendon . . .

In this matchup
McClendon would win, and
let me tell you why.
McClendon’s ’ talents
include getting on first base,

Orioles game with the
Yankees was postponed after a 15-inning
thriller that never ended. -
Now, if this game means something
to the Yankees, Ripken’s last game will
once again be in the Big Apple, which
makes me sick. The winner of this
matchup is undoubtedly the world.

Dallas Cowboys vs. Washington
Redskins

Talk about the eventual . “toilet
bowl.” When the Redskins and Cowboys
play each other this season, we will see
two of the worst teams in the NFL face
off. ‘

Each team cut its preseason starting
quarterbacks, and chose more youthful
play callers. The Redskins have embar-
rassed themselves so far this season, and

stealing bases and picking
up bases and throwing them in a ﬁt of
anger. On the other hand, Meares often
drops the baseball. But when he does
throw it, it doesn’t go as far or as straight
as McClendon’s base did. This makes
McClendon the undisputed winner.
McClendon can throw the base farther
and straighter then Meares’ could ever
imagine.

Maryland vs. West Virginia

I wouldn_’t have put last weekend’s
matchup in here except for the fact that I
attended the game to watch Maryland,
my home team, trounce Pitt’s rival.

During this game, I saw and heard
the weirdest ways to support a football
team. Maryland fans were chanting, “go
back to the woods” to the West Virginia

fans throughout the game.

I also heard the cheer, “E-X-L-A-X.
What’s that spell? What does it make
you do? Go, Go, Go, Go, Go!” Lastly,
Maryland-put speakers in the student
section and had some sort of Superman-
looking fan getting the crowd riled up
during the entire game. I thought it was a
great idea, and an awesome way to get
fans into the game. The 32-20 Maryland
win was even better. V

Tony\Dorsett vs. Dan Marino

This is the best matchup of them all.
These are the two most famous Pitt foot-
ball players, hands down. Sorry, Ditka.

When I saw Pitt fans enter the stadi-
um for the Miami game Thursday night,
there was so much excitement to see
these «two players. During the halftime
ceremony, I made sure I was in a spot
where I could tell which Panther alumni
got the loudest and longest cheer. But _as
hard as I ‘listened, I couldn’t tell if
Marino or Dorsett won.

Dorsett has a slight advantage
because he won a championship for Pitt

' in 1976. Marino ﬁnished No. 2 in 1981.

Therefore, Dorsett takes it over Marino
by a hair.

Homer Simpson vs. Moe

This classic matchup turns a classic
television show into an epic battle
between a bartender and a drunken main
character. Simpson has the love of alco-
hol and a beautiful wife to go along with
three kids. He also has the perfect job
where he can sleep all day.

Moe, on the other hand, slaves over
his bar and has to deal with people like
Homer and Barney all night. But the
winner of this matchup is Moe because
he has “The Flaming Moe.” Happiness is
just a Flaming Moe away! ‘

‘ ‘So there you have my picks of the
year.

I just have one question for my read- ,

ers. Who would win Ditka vs. terrorism?

Backwards this wrote and News Pitt Ihe
for writer sports a is Goldman Brian.

Irish and Panthers look to break losing streaks

Coaches’ corner, page 9

said. “I’m not saying that he is
going to start. His challenge is exe-
cuting the plays.”

The no-huddle offense is new
for the Panthersthis year. Harris has
never liked this type of offense,
which is designed to confuse and
startle the defense. But even with
this offense, Pitt is having trouble

A getting the snap off before the play

clock runs out, and some Panther
receivers aren’t receiving the play
calls on the line of scrimmage.

“We shouldn’t have clock penal-
ties,” Harris said. “We were slow on
the sidelines. I take responsibility
for this. Players have to run out
there faster.”

But Harris was impressed with
his offensive line against Miami.
The line was thepweakest link of the
Panther team coming into the sea-

son, but its improvement has
bestowed more of a running game in
the Panther offensive attack.

“The offensive line was the

most improved of the game,” Harris _

said. “We ran the ball much better.
The offensive line is our biggest
challenge because they are the hard-
est to recruit.” \

Come Saturday, both Pitt and
Notre Dame will try to end respec-
tive losing streaks and win again.

Notre Dame is 0-3 for the first time
in the school’s history and the
Panthers'haven’t had a losing record
in more than a year until now.

“Pitt will be scratching and
crawling for a win,” Davie said. “I
just want to wina game. It’s that
simple for me.”

Game time Saturday is 2:30’
‘pm. at Notre Dame Field in-South

Bend, Ind. The game will be tele-
vised nationally on" NBC.

Miami follows Pittwin with feast VS. T roys State

Teleconference, page 9

Nunes started in place of R.J.
Anderson, who was sick.

“We have a policy here where a
guy doesn’t lose his job because he
got sick. Troy is not disappointed,
he understands what his role will
be,” Pasqualoni said.

Syracuse (3-2, 0-0 Big East) is
coming off a 44-30 winvagainst East
Carolina. The Orangemen put up 44
points against an East Carolina
defense that has many talented
players.

Rutgers came off a disappoint-
ing " 20-19 loss to Connecticut.
Scarlet Knights coach Greg Schiano
gave players the day off on Sunday.

“I thought it was time for them
to get their heads out of the forest
and get their minds off football for
awhile,” Schiano said.

Rutgers will have to focus on
trying to-stop Syracuse pass rusher
Dwight Freeney. Freeney recorded
sacks in 13 straight games, and
already has 10 this season.

Schiano said, “I don’t think [the
media] give[s] him enough credit;
he is the finest pass rusher in«the
nation.”

Summing up the key to a Victo-

ry for the Scarlet Knights Schiano ,
‘ said “Our kids are going to have to
"do everything right in order to win

this week.”

The last time the Scarlet
Knights overcame the Orangemen
was in 1999 when they posted a 24-

' 21-overtime victory.

Temple tries for first Win at

Boston College since 1990 ,
Temple (1-2, 0-0 Big East) came

off a two—week layoffand last won-

in 1990 to Boston College (3-1, 1-0
Big East). The Eagles have Won six
straight games at Alumni Stadium.

“The biggest thing [the layoff]
has given us [is] time to work on
some things like running the foot-
ball better,” Temple coach Bobby
Wallace said. Boston College isn’t
going to make running the ball any
easier for the Owls as it plays vari-
ous pressure and zone blitz defen-
sive packages.

Boston College running back
William Green leads the Big East in
rushing ’ (150.0 ypg) and has 600
yards this season. Green will try" to
attain his 9th career 100-yard game
against an Owl defense that is third
in the league,_ allowing 94.0 yards
per game. Wallace said, “They have
-one of the best tailbacks in the
country. We have to be concerned
about stopping Green.”

Boston College won big last

week against Army 31-10,. but
Eagles coach Tom O’Brien was dis-
satisfied. “We could have done a lot
better last week, including William.
Hopefully this being a conference
game, this will help us in not hav-
ing to play a service academy two
weeks in a row,” O’Brien said.

Boston College beat Temple 31-
3 last year. Quarterback Brian St.
Pierre was 11 of 16 in that game for
165 yards.

Troy State faces No.11-ranked

‘ Miami at the Orange Bowl

In its first meeting against a Big

  

East team, Troy State (1-2) will
most definitely have its hands full
when playing the Miami Hurricanes
(3-0, 2-0 Big East), who come into
the game ranked N o. 1 in the nation.

“Troy State is a very athletic
team, andia very quick team. They
will be a challenge coming into the
Orange Bowl,” Miami head coach
Larry Coker said.

Most media questions‘ for Coker
during the teleconference were not
about this week’s game.

Many asked whether Miami can
hold their No. 1 rank.

Coker said, “We have our hands

full, especially our last four games
of the season.” The Hurricanes still
have to face Florida State, Boston
College, Syracuse and Virginia
Tech at Blacksburg to close the sea-
son.
The Miami Hurricanes held
their opponent to seven points or
less in five of its last six games. Pitt
scored 21 points last week against
the Hurricanes. Miami also leads
the conference in passing (294.3
ypg) and total offense (537.0 ypg).

Troy State did not play this past
week. In their last game the Trojans
beat Nicholls State 26-0.
