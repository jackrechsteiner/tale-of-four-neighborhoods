Haitian culture featured for bicentennial

An endless stream of hatsflew
around the city, destroying build-

ings and attacking the residents of

the community.

This was just one of the paint-
ings featured at a slide show on
Haitian Art and Culture, part of a
series of events commemorating the
bicentennial of Haitian indepen-
dence. . _

The‘ painting represented a
belief that notorious Haitian leader

“Papa .Doc,” could kill a man with
only his hat.

The slide show was held in the
Lower Lounge of the William Pitt
Union last Friday evening and was
one of the many events co—spon-
sored by Pitt’s Department of
Africana Studies, the Caribbean and
Latin American Student
Association, Penn ‘ Sta”te’s
McKeesport Campus, and the

“Two hundred years ago, the
French colony of St. Domingue was
liberated as the nation of Haiti. This
was an event that transformed the
history of not just that Caribbean’
island country, but also of the west-
ern hemisphere, and indeed the

Pitt researchers
pursue SARS
vaccination

NICK KEPPLER
Staff Writer

Last year, Pitt researchers com-
pleted the first published‘ trial of a
severe acute respiratory syndrome,
or SARS, vaccine-on monkeys, and
they will soon be ready to test it on
human volunteers, according to the
leader of the research team.

“We’ve started writing clinical
protocols and are moving in that
direction as..quickly as possible,”
said head researcher Dr. Andrea
Gambotto, referring to a clinical trial
on humans. ,.  “

The vaccine being tested was not
engineered using any part of the
SARS virus. ,‘

It attempts to build immunity to
the virus that spreads SARS by
the body with ; mild
pathogens that are similar.- It is
impossible that volunteers will con-
tract SARS from the clinical test. '

According to Gambotto, volun-
teers will have only little risk of
being harmed in any other way from
the testing and the trial should be
very safe, though the research tar-
gets a deadly disease.

SARS is a mysterious disease
that causes fever, body aches and
extreme breathing problems.

. The syndrome was never seen in
humans. before last February, when

-an outbreak occurred in China. By

May, SARS was an international
health crisis, having spread through
international air travel-. '

The disease affected China,
Singapore, Taiwan and Canada most
seriously, though more than 30 coun-
tries reported SARS cases, according
to the World Health Organization.

sories halted the epidemic, but not_

Local can’t shake eerie encounters

NICK KEPPLER
Staff Writer

Gennie Fritz didn’t sleep in her own bedroom
for six years.

“When I would go to bed at night, my bed
would shake,” she recalled. Terrified, Fritz, then

11 years old, would only sleep either in her moth- ’

er’s bedroom or on the couch; the behavior con-

tinued until she left for college.

The shaking bed was not the only strange
thing that happened to Fritz. She has predicted a
plane crash, seen orbs of light dance around her
room and seen glimpses of strange shadow fig-
ures.

Fritz recounts her experiences of living in two
haunted houses, one in Pittsburgh and the other in
Wilkes—Barre, Pa., on HauntedDiary.com and
GhostChatter.com — sister sites that have attract-
ed a massive community of paranormal buffs.
About 2,200 people have registered to chat at
GhostChatter.com.

“[My mother and I] felt a need to share our
experiences, and we wanted a place where other
people could go and say, ‘Oh, I am having these
things happen to me, too’,” Fritz said.

Until age 18, Fritz lived with her mother and
brother in a haunted house in the South Hills, a

Pittsburgh suburb. The first paranormal experi- ,

ence she can remember — the plane crash predic-
tion occurred when she was 4 years old.

“I remember looking outside my bedroom
window and seeing a plane crash into what looked
like the woods below,” Fritz recalled.

She ran screaming to her mother, but no plane
had crashed — until later that evening.
HauntedDiary.com has a newspaper clipping
about the crash.

Growing up, Fritz had more bizarre experi-
ences. Twink1y—sounding music, “something simi-
lar to a melody from a music box,” seemed to
come from nowhere. Glowing orbs which she
nicknamed “Tinkerbell” —- danced around her
bedroom. A shadow figure appeared in front of the
family’s Christmas tree. The figure slowly devel-
oped arms, then legs, then a torso. Fritz, age 11,
hid under a blanket. 7

After a year at Slippery Rock University, Fritz
moved into a duplex in Wilkes—Barre with her
boyfriend. The duplex, apparently, was also
haunted. ‘ ’

“Jason had experiences there himself, before I _

came around, so it is not like I brought the ghosts
with me,” Fritz said of her boyfriend. - .

“I personally feel that this side [of the duplex]
is occupied by a mild spirit who doesn’t seem to
do much,” she said. Lumps of coal that mysteri-
ously appeared in the basement have been myste-
'riously repositioned. Shadow figures have
appeared in an old mirror that previous owners
left behind. .

In January .2002, Fritz and her mother
launched HauntedDiary.com, featuring their per-
sonal accounts and perplexing photographs from
inside the houses. GhostChatter.com was launched
in spring 2003, when Fritz’s MSNBC-hosted chat

To the Editor:

I wish to clarify information concerning
salary raises forfaculty and staff reported in the
Jan. 7 edition of Pitt News as follows:

On Oct. 15, the University announced passage
of the University’s budget and indicated that,
“The budget establishes an increase of one and
one-half percent to the salary pool available for
raises for faculty and staff members for satisfacto-
ry performance. An additional pool of one and
one-half percent is designated for merit, market,
and equity pay increases.”

In the latter pool, ’_one percent is available to
University units, and the remaining one-half per-
cent of the faculty and stafflsalary base has been
maintained by the seniorofﬁcers of the University
to address unit—level -cornpensation issues.

Changes in Residence Life
not felt strongly by students

J. ELIZABETH STROHM
News Editor

Students might not know who
Deborah Furka is, but she has con-
trol over a major part of their daily

As the ‘ new
director of

at Pitt, she over-3
sees the depart-
ment in charge
of most every-
thing dealing
"with life in
University hous-
ing. '
The position
Furka now holds ’

was changed
from assistant to
the dean for

Residence Life
to director of
Residence Life
when Denine
Rocco resigned’
from the position July 25, 2003.
Associate Dean of Student
Affairs Birney Harrigan held the
position of interim (director of
Residence Life until Furka took
over as director on Oct. 1, 2003.

« Furka said that, despite the big
role of Residence Life in on-cam-
pus housing, students don’t general-
ly see the effects of her daily work.

The changes_in the department,
she said, will probably also affect
them mostly in ways they won’t
notice. ' A

“I think that what they will con-
tinue to see is a staff that is very
concerned about A them in their
development,” she said, “and as
students, and as residence hall stu-
dents who are growing, learning
and developing within a community
setting.” A

Rocco resigned July 25 to work
at the University of Akron as the‘

 

interim associate vice president of
Student Affairs, where former Pitt
Dean of Students Sharon Johnson
was working as the interim vice
president for Student Affairs.
Furka came to Pitt nearly six
' years ago to

‘chief. * Several
years later, she
became the
‘director of pub-
lic safety — a
position that she
held until her
move ' to
Residence Life.
She said that
her other jobs
here allowed her
to become famil-
iar with many of
the people work-
ing in and with
Residence Life,
though she said
she works with
them in different
capacities now than she did as
police chief or director of public
safety.

Sheadded that her experience
as a student security aide at Kent.
State, her alma mater, gavelher “a
really good base of understanding
in Residence Life.” .

“Because I had worked in th
environment [of Residence Life]
before, it was a matter of getting
acclimated to the procedures in this
environment,” she said.

"In an interview last semester,
Dean of Students and Vice Provost
for Undergraduate Studies Jack
Daniel said that he chose Furka
because of her experience dealing

, with crises. -

He explained that, last year,
many health and safety issues
arose, both in residence halls and in
fraternity houses._ ' P

Researchers can’t test SARS
on monkeys, must use ferrets

SARS, page 1

before 774 people died and more
than 8,000 were infected.

A few cases have been reported
in recent months, but none have been
confirmed.

Standard antiviral drugs have not
been effective against SARS, and
experts are unsure of how to treat it.

Researchers do know, however,
that SARS is spread by a coron-
avirus, a member of the Virus family
that includes the common cold.

This finding
led to the vaccine

said.

In July, when Gambotto had
already begun to test monkeys,
researchers at the University of

Rotterdam in the Netherlands dis-

covered that, even if infected with
the SARS coronavirus, monkeys do
not develop SARS.

“The final proof that the vaccine
is working is to challenge the animal
with the actual virus,” he said. “But
this was not possible because mon-
keys do not get sick with SARS.”

In October, the researc-hers at '

Rotterdam dis-
covered that fer-

being tested at
Pitt.

tem to generate a ‘, SARS coron-

Gambotto said.
Gambotto has

cells with little

discomfort to the

test subject, making the virus type a
valuable tool for such research.

The theory behind the vaccine
was that the subject’s immune sys-
tem would fight the adenovirus, and
then develop a general immunity to
coronaviruses — including the one
that causes SARS.

In June, ,Gambotto’s team used
funding from the National Institutes
of Health to test the vaccine on six
rhesus macaques, a type of monkey.

In August, his team discovered
that the animals had developed a
general immunity to coronaviruses.

In December, Gambotto and her
team published their findings in The
Lancet Medical Journal. I

This was the first published test-
ing of a SARS vaccine, but its
importance was somewhat reduced
by the discovery, made a few months
earlier, that monkeys are an unsuit-
able test subject for a SARS vaccine.

“Our experience working on an
HIV vaccine showed that the closer
you go to humans in your animal
model, the more chance you have of
finding» a good model, but this was
not the case for SARS,” Gambotto

with the

, researchers at

Rotterdam, who are also testing a
vaccine on ferrets.

He said that the ferret study will
be another opportunity to detect any
toxicity in the vaccine. .

Also, if the vaccine fails to pre-
vent the ferrets, from contracting
SARS, the team will already know it
will not like-ly be effective for
humans.‘ ' ' .

Meanwhile, Gambotto has
already planned a trial using human
volunteers and is waiting for the
completion of the ferret study,
approval from the Food and Drug
Administration andadditional fund-
ing. '

His team must also engineer an
ideal vaccine to be used in the study
— the process could take as many as
six months. '

“These are all things you do in

parallel, so you don’t wait for one or E

the other first,” Gambotto said.
Gambotto predicted that his team

.would be ready to begin testing

human subjects sometime between
June and December of this year. .

Despite rough times, Haiti celebrates 200 years without the French

tory that many people associate
with Haiti, and he gave his own
interpretation.

“To me and most people around
the world, Haiti symbolizes free-
dom, the triumph of the human spir-
it, and unbounded resourcefulness
and creativity —- ideals that we
want to celebrate today,” Adjaye
said.

Another one of the. speakers,
Bill Bollendorf, is an art dealer and
frequent visitor to Haiti. .

Part of his collection was set up
for viewing near the Lower Lounge

of the William Pitt Union.

Bollendorf talked about Haiti’s
colonial period and the decimation
of the native Taino people after the
initial landing of Columbus in
1492. V

Bollendorf also spoke of Haiti’s
politically troubled past.

“Between 1843 and 1915,’ there.

were 22 presidents. Only one served

‘his full term,” he said.

Counting the beauty of the
country as one of the reasons people
love the small Caribbean nation,
Bollendorf also cited the character
of the citizens of Haiti.

“The other thing we like is the
dignity -of the people,” said
Bollendorf.

While visiting the Haitian capi-
tal Port—au—Prince, Bill Bollendorf
encountered, a group of men

[weightlifting with used car parts.

When he asked what was going on,
one of the men responded, “It’s a
Spa.” ‘

Some of the slides featured pho-
tographs taken on one of his trips to
Haiti. '

Many pictures featured Port—au-
Prince, and one showed the statue
of Neg Mawon. -

Neg Mawon is often translated
as “the unknown slave,” represent-
ing the slaves who eventually
became part of the army that
brought independence to Haiti.

Bollendorf ended the slide show
with a series of pictures featuring
the children of Haiti.

.“These faces are why we love
Haiti so much,” Bollendorf said.

'When asked to explain his love
for Haiti in greater detail,
Bollendorf pinpointed the ,country’s
attraction.

“It’s very inspirational to be
there,” he said.

ghosts bring the

room became troublesome.

Fritz chats online when her 14-
month-old daughter is napping,
though the baby’s grandmother,
immobilized by a bad leg, is the
main administrator of the site.

About 30 people gatheredat the
community’s two off-line get-
togethers —- the first, in July 2003,
was at Point View Hotel in
Brentwood, Pa., and the second, the
following October, was at Larry’s
Roadhouse in Brookline, Pa. Both

places “are supposedly haunted.’ ‘

“It took researching on our part,
because you don’t go up to someone
and say, ‘Hey, you got a ghost in that
building?”’ she said. “Wehad a tour
andigot to ‘hear about the history of
the buildings.”

«The group also used an Ouija
board. Some people reported “feel-
ing a presence.” -

Fritz is planning a third get-
together in Pittsburgh next spring.

“We are planning a haunted bed
and breakfast, where people can stay
overnight if they want,” she said.
“We are anticipating a lot will come
to this one —— maybe 100, if not
more.” -

Fritz thinks that the ghosts she
has encountered are previous’ owners
of’ the houses but does not know
exactly what they want.

“They might be lost or lonely. I
think it depends on the spirit.”

Even though she has a daughter
now, Fritz does not ‘mind sharing her
home with ghosts, under one condi-
tion + “as long as whatever it is
isn’t scary.”

When asked if students could
do anything to make things easier
for those working in Residence
Life, Furka said that things work
best “if students live in the halls
with a mutual respect for them-
selves, others andvthe facilities.”

She added that many students
already live in’ such away, making
the environment “comfortable, safe
and enjoyable.”

Beyond showing respect, stu-
dents can help by taking an active
part in programming, as well as
other activities on and off campus,
Furka said. i

“There are a lot of things stu-
dents _can get involved in that will
help them” in the future, she said.

Much of her work, she said, has
gone toward “being able to get peo-
ple in place.” «

Some of these newly placed
people-include Deborah Walker, the
newly appointed assistant director
for community standards_; Keyon
Bonner,. the assistant director of
staff services; and‘Kathleen Kyle,
the assistant director of program-
ming. __

Each person, Furka said, will
affect Residence Life in a different
way: Walker by developing stan-

V dards for activities and living with-

“You program differently for

your freshmen students than you

wouldfor someone dealing with a

residence hall with primarily
upperclassmen,” Furka said,
explaining ' how programming

Gambotto: Vaccine has little risk

SARS, page 4

Gambotto said that the most sig-
nificant risk to volunteers is the
minor chance that the vaccine itself
would be discovered to be toxic.

“This is not done with the actual
SARS virus, so there is no risk to
become infected with SARS,” he
said. '

“It would be a different story if
we proposed a vaccine like the
Chinese vaccine, which is an inacti-
vated virus. Then there is a chance,
even though limited, that you could
get infected, and it would be more
difficult to convince people to

3;

become volunteers,” he added.
Gambotto acknowledged that the
media attention concerning SARS
might initially turn away potential
volunteers, but he expects that vol-

unteers will be comforted when they

learn of the impossibility of contact-
ing SARS and improbability that the
vaccine will making a person ill in
some other way, '

“Usually it is not difficult to find
people who are willing to test,”
Gambotto said.

“But, of course, you have to
inform them.”

EDITORIAL

When did planning forlraqwar begin?

The United States’ justification
for invasion and continued occupa-
tion of Iraq grows more and more
threadbare as the days linger, the
deaths mount and the purported rea-
sons —— like weapons of mass
destruction or links to Al-Qaida —
remain unfound. ‘

Former Treasury Secretary Paul

lO’Neill, fired by President Bush at

the end of 2002, contends that Bush
began laying the groundwork for an
invasion days after taking office in
2001, well before the terrorist
attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.

In an interview with “60
Minutes” that aired Saturday, for-
mer Pitt trustee and current member
of the UPMC Board of Directors
O’Nei1l said that U.S. pre—emptive
planning to oust Saddam Hussein
was a “huge leap.”

O’Neill is a man noted for his
business ethics, having spoken at
both Pitt and Duquesne University
on the topic.

As someone who has been oust-
ed from the Washington political
scene, it seems unlikely that he has
any particular agenda in expressing
his unease, other than the pursuit of
truth and fairness.

While it is true that eventually
ousting Hussein has been a stated
goal of the United States since at
least the Clinton administration, it
is disquieting that the Bush admin-

istration may have begun planning
for such an event so’ early.

Bush’s slippery justifications
smack of using a terrible tragedy to
justify and excuse a plan 'he’d been
working on formonths.

What if the attacks had never
happened? What if the administra-
tion had heeded urgent commu-
niqiies from the CIA and other
intelligence agencies and averted
the horror of that day?

What shaky rationalization
would Bush have used then to drum
up support for his ill-thought-out
attacks?

As American troops continue to
perish and the term “quagmire”
becomes increasingly relevant to
the situation in Iraq, it is worth
pondering: if Bush has been plan-
ning to invade Iraq since just about
day one of his presidency, why was-
n’t it better planned? If this has
been in the works since 2001, per-
haps some fair plan for rebuilding
could have been worked out.

No one disputes that Hussein
was a ruthless dictator, and that the
world is probably better off without
him in power.

Perhaps it would have been
more difficult for Bush to convince
Americans of the need to attack
without a national tragedy, but it
would certainly have been more
honest.

No play t6 be had over the long holidays

Well kids, I_/éked for your crazy sex-
ploits from the"lon‘g break, and I got nary
a one. You prior celibates have my sym-
pathy. No y’s gotten any play since
2003? Ag/' at’s really a shame. So, in
respons; ‘ to the roughly one million
inquiries I’ve gotten on the subject, I am
going/ to go over every spicy sizzling
detail of my own sex life here, for your
entertainment and ediﬁcation. '

Ha ha! Gotcha!

Instead, I’m going to delve deep into
my mailbox and share with you the frigid
ramblings of a possibly nasty »
old codger, possibly wearing a
stained raincoat, and a man
completely drunk on Hate—o-
rade. Enjoy, and if any of you
start remembering good holi-
day sex tales for me, I will still
print them. I

 

term “coeds” that you are probably of
middle age, which officially makes you
gross, considering you are advising 18-
year-old women to try “torturing” the fac
ulty and staff. ’

Before I begin tearing you a new ori-
ﬁce, I would like to state that it’s not out-
side the realm of possibility for joyful,
successful, non-yicky unions to take place
between people of disparate ages. Hell, if
my father had taken my mother to his high
school prom, he would have been arrest-
ed, and they’ve been happily rnanied for
25 years. However, such
unions almost never begin
with “torture.”

asking me to do for you is
convince the entire female
population of Pitt to shake
their tail-feathers at every
man they see. Sony, bub.

Dear Creepy Guy:

First, allow me to congratulate you.
Your e—mail is printed out and hanging in

Superficial encouragement meant to lure Hispanic voters

Note: This is the second part ofa two—part series
dealing with the United States’ immigration poli-
cies.

On Jan. 7, President George W. Bush brought
immigration back into the forefront of American
political debate with his proposal for granting tem-
porary work visas to illegal immigrants. Upon the
expiration of their visas, they would be eligible to
take a slim chance at citizenship or be forced to
return to their native countries.

This newfound interest in immigration reform
seems superficially encouraging; unfortunately,
Bush’s recent statements belie his administration’s
action — or, more accurately, inaction — in the
realm of such reform to date.

Frank Sharry, the executive director of the
National Immigration Forum, laid out a list of
necessities that any immigration reform proposal

must contain to be an effective revamping of

American law. This list included “a path to citizen-
ship for those who want to embrace the American
Dream and become full partners in our shared
future,” and “vigorous support for the bipartisan
AgJOBS and DREAM Act proposals pending in
Congress.”

So where does Bush’s proposal fall short? In a
previous column, I addressed some of the inadequa-
cies of Bush’s plan in meeting the first criterion
mentioned above. But Bush has also fallen short in
regard to the latter of Sharry’s necessities, in his

administration’s ‘failure to support the AgJ OBS and

DREAM Act proposals.
AgJOBS would provide a system for illegal
agricultural workers to first gain temporary and

then permanent resident status, and would revise
existing immigration law to be
user—friendly for employers and
provide greater protections for
workers. The guarantee of a
process that leads directly to
American citizenship makes

and far fairer — proposal than
Bush’s “Six Years Max and You’re
Out” plan.

The DREAM Act would aid
the American—born children of ille-
gal immigrants by disposing of a
federal provision that dictates how
states determine resident status for
financial aid qualifications, allow-
ing greater leeway for immigrant .
college hopefuls, and would provide a way for
long—term resident students to apply for legal res_i—
dency. Again, DREAM is a much longer—term aid to
immigrants in America than the Bush proposal.

Bush has done ‘nothing to support either of these
measures. As Sen. Ted Kennedy (D—Mass.) said,
-‘~‘At any time in recent months, a nod from the
administration could have brought immediate
enactment of two important, long—stalled immigra-
tion bills with broad, bipartisan support in
Congress.”

Democrats like Kennedy are upset because
Bush’s plan doesn’t go far enough, while many of
Bush’s fellow Republicans are upset because they
think his plan goes too far in its temporary legaliza-
tion of illegal immigrants. ,So. why would Bush
introduce an immigration proposal that angers

Or maybe, just maybe, you are some
weirdo who likes strolling the campus to
see what the ladies are up to. Ew ew ew.

Your charming sunnnons at the end
of your note, inviting me to take up’ this
pressing subject with you personally,
makes me glad I don’t know your name,
and sadly, makes me a tiny bit leery of
every male member of the faculty and
staff, the vast majority of whom would be
severely discomﬁted by any female stu-
dent attempting to “torture” them. Thanks
a lot, jerkbox.

Dear Sex N’at:
You views are horrible and most of
the people that write you probably don’t

even have a girlfriend or boyfriend. They.

are just entertainedﬁby the thought :that
someone like you can give them advice
that will enhance their sexual appeal. You
should place a big L on your forehead.
———Pitt Dude

Dear Dude:

I wonder what it is about my views
that horriﬁes you so much. Is it that you
just can’t stomach the fact that people are
having ca—ray—zay sex lives and would
rather talk to me about it than you?

Lots of people that write to me don’t
have .a boyfriend or a girlfriend. Some
have both! Some have neither because
they don’t want to. Some want to know
how to change their current status.

I wonder why you are so bitter and
angry. Perhaps it has been a while. Lack
of nookie can do that to a man, I’m told.

It’s awfully kind of you to ascribe me
the magical power of simply advising
someone into a state of higher sex appeal.
Thank you. i

If I could do that, I would be in busi-
ness for life. I wish I could, but really, sex

 appeal is a mysterious thing, different for
3 everyone and depending on a number of

factors, like looks, smoothness, and not
being an angry, bitter snipe.
Hugs and kisses, you sad little man!

Ask Melissa Meinzer a question at
sex@pittnews.com.

Republicans and Democrats alike?

This is an election year, and Bush
has the Hispanic vote to think about.
The 2000 census revealed that

, Hispanics comprise the fastest grow-
ing minority population in America,
representing 12.5 percent of the popu—
lation, and therefore an important vot-
ing bloc.

Immigration is a vital political issue
for Hispanics. In August of 2003, the
McLaughlin and Associates’
Opiniones Latinas poll for the Latino

r Coalition and Hispanic Business
Roundtable found that 86.7 percent of
Latinos favor a policy that would
“normalize the status of illegal immi—
grant workers in this country,”,» and

90.8 percent think it is “important” that “America’s/,
immigration laws be reformed in order to reduce
illegal immigration by promoting a system which
increases the legal ﬂow of workers into this coun-
try.” ‘

In short, Bush is trying to ‘win the Hispanic vote
in November, while doing as little as he can to enact
real, fair change in American immigration law.

As Sen. Joe Lieberman (D—Conn.) said, Bush
has “had an election year conversion to immigra-
tion reform, but it’s too little and three years too
late.”

Sabrina Spiher still encourages her fellow
Democrats‘ to support Joe Lieberman in the upcom-
ing presidential primary. Find out how you can help

Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906

PAGE 12

Just another excuse to get naked?

It’s that time of the year again, when boob-
tubers get another delicious taste of reality TV
from its originators. A new season of “The Real
World” started last Tuesday, and, for those who
may not have seen any of the episodes thus far,
the cast is again hunky and gorgeous.

Yes, MTV and Bunim-Murray, the producers
of the show that has been running strong for
more than a decade —— it’s now in its 14th season
— have no intentions of discontinuing the show.

“The Real World” and “Road Rules” still
bring in the most ratings for MTV. New shows
on the Music Television channel have a lifespan
of about one season and, for the most part, don’t
even last a regular season’s length. With the
attention span of the United States - growing
shorter and shorter every day, it becomes easy to
lose interest in something that only appears on a
screen for less than 30 minutes and less than a
season. A '

_ That being said, I congratulate MTV for
finding something that does last longer than a
measly season, and it’s nice to see that what
started as an experiment of a show, with seven
strangers picked to live in an apartment in New
York City, in the very first season, has made its
way throughout the United -States and even
abroad.

Reality television viewers have lived through
these people every year, watching everything
they do, listening to every conversation and
every love session. It’s voyeurism at its lowest
point, but it’s all legal and it sells.

I don’t have a problem with MTV continuing
“The Real World” every year and doing almost
the same thing over and over again, despite its

shoot

tendency to get monotonous when the seasons
start running several months for no reason'what-
soever. I have lost’ interest in several casts in
previous seasons, -
-most recently sea-
son l3 in Parisp
They bored the hell
out of me halfway
through that long
and arduous season.
What I have a

 

problem i with,
though, is that
every season, no

matter what loca-
tion they choose to
the show,
there is always a
cast of seven gor-
geous people. There
is rarely a ﬂaw with
the cast members in the looks category. The guys
are all hunks who wear Abercrombie and Fitch
while walking around exposing their perfectly
toned six packs. The women are all sex bombs
who walk around teasing the men until a hook-
up occurs. Then, of course, controversy ensues.
For the most part, such a cast lacks the

Brian Palmer    

 

charisma that is needed to keep an audience.

interested for an entire season; they are general-
ly just hot things for the audience to goggle over.
In the entire span of “The Real World” there

— has never been a portly man in the“cast. Neverf
Yes, I know last season of “Road Rules”-‘had...

one — poor Darnell who couldn’t accomplish half
the missions but could kiss enough behind to

keep from being left on /for half of the show. He
did, however, eventually getvoted off. But this
isn’t about “Road Rules.” ‘ . ‘ ‘
In the entire 14 seasons of “The Real World,”
there has never‘ been a husky male cast member.
OK, I know what you are thinking: they aren’t
entirely size discriminatory. There have been
some ladies of size represented. Sharon, from
“Real World London,” the fourth season, and
Heather from season one in New York were both
big girls. _
Oh, wow, a who1e_two in 14 seasons, [and
those came early on in the history of the show.
What “The Real-.World”;needs is -a. rotund

man to go onthere and liven things, up a bit,. .
— someone who isn’t‘ afraid of making. a complete

and total fool outof himself for the betterment
of the broadcast. _“The Real World” needs some-

one with whom everyone can get along for the ‘

most part, but can hate for a period of time as
well.’ .

I’m not a hunky guy with six—pack abs and
great pecs. I’m a large, loveable guy who wants
to have a good time, but can cause controversy,
as well..

I want to be on “The Real World,” damn it.

I think I’d be great "on the show, and rumor
has it that there may be one shot in Pittsburgh.

Sign me up; let me be the local guy who shows
everyone on the cast how -to have fun in the ~

Off the wire: Jay-Z opensup for one lastlyrical ride

B.C. BAKER
The Lantern (Ohio State U.)

(U-WIRE). - With the release of his
supposed last CD, The Black Album,
Jay—Z plans on ending his illustrious
career on a high note. Often compar-
ing himself to Michael Jordan, Jay—Z
does not want to be remembered as
one of the greats that simply stuck
around too long. The Brooklyn native
feels that his career is unparalleled,
and that he has nothing more to
accomplish. With nine albums ineight
years, critical acclaim and multiple
awards and nominations, it is hard to
argue with that claim. ,

Although the opinions of those
who believe J ay—Z is all about women
and jewelry probably won’t change
after hearing the album’s first single,
“Change Clothes,” listeners will be
pleased to hear the wide range of top-

ics J ay—Z covers in nearly an hour. On

his final opus, J ay—Z seems bored with
the current state of the rap game and,
as a result, pushes his art to high lev-
els of creativity. This includes taking

on a varietyof concepts as well as,

enlisting a different producer for
almost everysong. A

Throughout the disc, the artist
shows depth in his lyrics, regardless
of the subject. On “December 4th,”
Jay—Z discusses the struggle of grow-
ing up in a_single—parent home. The
track even features. vocals from the
rapper’s mother, who reveals interest-
ing facts about one of the best to ever
pick up a microphone.

The appropriately titled, Eminem-
produced,
expands on the nonexistent relation-

” ship Jay-Z had with his father. The
‘ MC reveals that he was able to recon-

cile with his father —— who had walked
out of his life — just shortly before his
father died last year. It is this type of
willingness to express inner feelings
that has drawn fans to J ay-Z over the
years. i
Hip—hop purists will love the hard:
core thump of “Public: Service
Announcement,” the clever wordplay

3 on “99 Problems,” and the sinister

“Threat,” which features vocals by
Cedric the -Entertainer. Meanwhile,
songs like “What More Can I Say”
and “Encore” actually play on the fact
that ‘Jay-Z is retiring. The latter is an
audio re—enactment of his last concert,
filled with roaring screams from the
crowd. .

However, two songs in particular,
“Justify My Thug” and “Allure,” real-
ly display the specialartist that Jay—Z
is.  “Justify,” J ay-Z is smart enough
to couple his politically c1iarged'lyrics
with an up—tempo, dance—ready DJ
Quik track to ensure that everyone
hears his frustration. “Mr. President,

“Moment of C1arity,”V

there’s drugs in our residence; tell me
what you want me to do, come break
bread with us. Mr. Governor, I swear
there’s a cover-up. Every other corner
there’s a liquor store, what the f—- is
up?” asks J ay-Z. It is quite remarkable
to hear a multi—millionaire express so
much concern for the poverty-stricken
areas in America and the lack of care
and involvement by the government.
Leave it up to the self—proclaimed
“’Hova”’ of rap to discuss issues that
others remain silent about. V

“Allure” is Jay-Z’s acknowledge-.1
ment of his tendency to indulge in the .

fast life, as wellas ‘his pledge to slow

it down. Behind a bass—heavy string
and piano backdrop provided by the
Neptunes, he vividly depicts the ups
and downsof the drug—dealing life he
ledjprior to his music career and his

‘want for change. His self-examination

has been consistent throughout his
catalog of classic albums and allows
his listeners to relate to him.

From start to finish, the music on '

The Black Album is as heavy in mean-
ingful content as anything J ay-Z has

’ ever recorded. Producers Kanye West,
Just Blaze and Timbaland all make‘
sure listeners dance and nod their

"heads while Jay-Z takes them on a

lyrical ride. Not since the “Hard
Knock Life” days has his versatility
on an album been shown like this.
After a few listens, it becomes obvi-
ous what a great talent the rap game
will be losing. ,

The artist has created timeless
music year after year, but despite cre-
ating a great farewell album, Jay-Z
still feels slightly under—appreciated.
The rapper sounds hurt when he says,
“I’m supposed to be No. l on every-
body’s list. We’ll see what happens
when I no longer exist.” Yet, if J ay-Z
is not No. 1, he shouldn’t be much fur-
ther behind.

The latest reality show gets help from Trump

“The Apprentice”

NBC
Thursday 8:30 pm
Producers: Mark Burnett,

Donald Trump
ﬁkikﬁk '

Deep in the heart of New York
City, sixteen men and women arrive
at Trump Tower for a job interview
unlike any other in NBC’s newest
reality show “The Apprentice.”
Created by Mark Burnett, executive
producer of CBS’ reality show
“Survivor,” these business hopefuls
have their entrepreneurial spirit put
to the ultimate test.

“The Apprentice” is a little
more comfortable than “Survivor”
but just as ruthless. The jungle
becomes concrete and the attire
is business—formal. The prize has
changed from a million dollars
to a prestigious job with a large
salary — the winner will become
president S of one of Donald
Trump’s companies.

Donald Trump is, more or less,
the personable host and antagonist
of the show who gives the contes-
tants plenty of serious looks in
order to fit the part. With the help
of his two assistants, Trump calls
the shots in the boardroom,
which is similar to “Survivor’s”
Tribal Council. It’s a place the
contestants do not want to end
up after they’ve completed
their assigned tasks. If a team
ends up in the boardroom, it
has lost, and one member is
going to be fired.

The contestants come
from all different back-
grounds. Some are Ivy-
league educated and
others have only a
high school educa-
tion. What they all
have in common
is an impres-
sive back-
ground in
business
and a
desire
f o r
t h e
prize.
Each

 

 

team is made of eight men and eight
women. There is a different leader
chosen for every task,- and if the
team fails, the leader must take
responsibility for the failure and
assign blame on two other members
of the team. From these three,
Trump chooses the team member he
will fire and send home.

For the first task, the teams had
to sell lemonade on the streets of
New York on a hot summer day.
Seeing the men and women bicker
with each other in drooping suits
and pinching heels was quite enter-
taining. It’s

harder for these teams to work
together because, unlike teammates
in “Survivor,” these people aren’t in
an unfamiliar situation. They’ve all
worked in business ventures before
and are experienced, so sharing
ideas is even more of a struggle.
This conflict is what makes the

show enjoyable and keeps the

drama strong. V , »
The scenery ofthe show is-falso

impressive. Not_ only are the contes.-ii

tants running all over New,York
City, but they also get to see some

of Trump’s moststriking buildings. T

Apartment-s may not be viewed
quite the same after seeing some of

the. apartments that Donald Trump

owns. It may be just a taste of the
lifestyle that is awaiting the winner.
“The Apprentice” is anything

.but boring, as the most intense job

interview of a lifetime continues.
With the rich diversity of the con-
testants, it won’t be hard for
everyone to pick a favorite and
cheer them on through the tasks
coming up in the next weeks.
“The Apprentice” airs on
NBC on Thursday nights at
‘ 8:30. -

Pitt survives Hurricanes,

BRIAN GOLDMAN
Staff Writer

CORAL GABLES, Fla. —- With less
then four seconds remaining in the
game, Miami’s Guillermo Diaz hit a
fade—away bank shot over Jaron
Brown to give the Hurricanes a 64-
62 lead. The Panthers’ perfect sea-
son seemed destined to end.

First year ‘ head coach Jamie
Dixon was not concerned. He still
had 3.9 seconds left in the ball-
game.~

Dixon called on a play that had
been practiced every day sincethe
season began. Carl Krauser, who
had missed the last four games with
a groin injury, got the inbounds
pass, ran the length of the court and
hit a layup to send the game into
overtime. Pitt eventually won in
double overtime 84-80 to improve
to a perfect 16-0 (2-0 in the Big
East) on the season.

“Coach [Dixon] separated him-
self from other coaches in the

league today,” Krauser said. “He

came into the huddle smiling after.
Diaz hit that shot. He said it was 8

OK, and we were not going to lose.”
Five different Panthers scored
in double figures. Krauser ledthe
way with 19, while Chris Taft had
17 points and nine rebounds and
Jaron Brown chipped in with 16
points and nine rebounds. Julius
Page added 15 points. A
Both teams started off shooting
the ball well. Pitt shot 59.1 percent
in the first half, while Miami shot

53.8 percent. Midway through the

firsthalf, the Panthers traile‘d,’l8-

16, when Antonio Graves hit-a A

three-pointer. The shot sparked Pitt,
whichwproceeded to go on a" 14-0
run, including a block and a dunk
from Taft and two steals by Chevon
Troutman. The run gave the
Panthers a 30-18 lead with six min-
utes remaining in the half.

But the Hurricanes would
respond, going on a 12-0 run of
their own, led by Diaz, who fin-

Panthers defeat Providence at
home for first conference win

Cheron Taylor watches her slit go up  Pitt’s

, JIMMY JOHNSON ,
Staff Writer

Sophomore forward Cheron Taylor had a
career day, helping the women’s basketball team
defeat the Providence Friars 64-51 at the Petersen
Events Center on Saturday.

Taylor scored 17 points while pulling down an
11 rebounds in only her second career start.

Two other Panthers, forward LaToya Kincaid
and guard Jessica Allen,’ scored in double digits.

. Allen finished with 12 points, with all coming on

four three-point shots. Kincaid scored a game-
high 18 points and pulled down 10 rebounds.

Freshman guard Brooke Hughes stepped into
a starting role for the first time in her collegiate
career, taking the place of. injured guard Amy
Kunich. Hughes scored five points and led the
team with six assists.

A couple of key plays kept the Panthers in the
game early.

Kincaid intercepted the ball and broke away
down the court, laying the ball up to put Pitt
ahead, 11-10.

Right after that, Allen took a pass from
Kincaid after a Friar turnover and hit a wide-open
three-pointer.

 Moments later, Taylor went after. a ball that
was heading out of bounds in the_offensive zone.
She saved it with her right hand and tossed it
behind her back in one swift movement. The pass
was perfectly placed into the hands of Hughes,
who lined up the three-point shot and sent it
through, putting Pitt up 21-16.

The first half shooting woes would allow the
Friars to get back into the game at halftime. Pitt
only hit 34.4 percent of its shots and finished the
half only three points in front of the Friars, 25-22.

The second half was a whole different story.
Head coach Agnus Berenato said the problem in
the first half was confidence. Her players were
taking shots, but they were not seeing the ball go
through the hoop.

“I thought they were hesitant in shooting,”
Berenato said.

The Panthers came out of the locker room for
the second half with a different mentality. They
saw their shots going through the hoop, and their
confidence was improved.

Pitt’s shooting percentage in the second half
was 51.7 percent — almost 18 percent higher than
in the first half.

Hughes helps lift Pitt in
first start as a Panther

JOE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

When starting point guard Amy
Kunich went down with a foot injury in
December, it looked to be a fatal blow
to Pitt’s season.

Kunich was the only returning
starter that the Panthers had heading
into the year and, in a season in which
first year head coach Agnus Berenato
was unsure of what kind of team she
was inheriting, it could have been dev-
astating.

But Pitt has managed to stay aﬂoat.
Against Providence on Saturday,
Berenato decided to make a switch by
inserting Brooke Hughes into the start-
ing lineup, and it worked, helping the
Panthers defeated the Friars.

Hughes, a freshman from
Wheelersburg, Ohio, was making her
first career start, and while her numbers
from the game aren’t eye—popping, her
aggressiveness and intensity helped Pitt
to the win.

“I found out the second before the
game,” said Hughes, who had a game-
high six assists to go along with ﬁve
points and three rebounds. “I expected

to be a little nervous, but it all turned
into adrenaline once the game started.”

After Providence jumped out to a
five-point lead early in the game,
Hughes had a hand in bringing the
Panthers back. Her layup with 12:26
left in the first half closed the gap to
one.

Hughes followed that up by ﬁnding
Cheron Taylor for a layup and LaToya
Kincaid for another basket that put Pitt
up by four.

When it seemed the Friars were
going to make a run of their own,
Hughes nailed a three—pointer to give
Pitt a ﬁve-point lead with 8:32 to go in
the first half.

On the other end of the ﬂoor, ‘

Hughes was at the front of Pitt’s pres-
sure defense, picking up the Friars’ ba1l_
handler as soon as the ball was in play.
Hughes’ pressure forced Providence
into a number of bad decisions, as the
Panthers forced 20 turnovers.

But despite her tough play in Pitt’s
win, Hughes is not guaranteed of keep-
ing the starting role.

“She earned it,” Berenato said of

Hughes, page 22 the Friars on Saturday.

Rip Van Winkle and sleeping for the
last month, you know about USC
and LSU, about the mess of the
Bowl Championship Series, that
Jason White won the Heisman,
Larry Fitzgerald is a god and Pitt
didn’t live up to expectations.
Nine months from now, another col-
lege football season will start, but
from now until then, Pitt has a few
issues it needs to address, so 1 pre-
sent you with the top‘l0 issues fac-
ing the Pitt football program.

No. 10: The mess of the BCS.

With Miami and Virginia Tech
leaving the Big East, the conference
takes an obvious hit as a power-
house in the world of college foot-
ball. Currently, the Big East cham-
pion receives an automatic bid to a

BCS game, but without their‘ two’

historically dominant teams, the

Big East may become the Mid-~

American Conference’s brother,
with only the hope of one of their
teams receiving an at—large bid to a
bowl game.

No. 9: Graduation.  _
Gerald Hayes, Torrie Cox and
Brian Guzek were just three of the
players gone this year thanks to
graduation. Without them on their

defense, the Panthers showed obvi-A .

ous signs of growing pains.
However, next year, the other

, side of the ball will suffer from

players receiving their diploma,
Quarterback Rod Rutherford, run-
ning back Brandon Miree and tight
end Kris Wilson are all leaving one

the most prolific offenses in Pitt .

history.

No. 8: Putting your leg into it.
During his freshman year,

David Abdul stole the kicking ,

duties away from a struggling J.B.

Gibboney, but after__Abdul finished ,
this season making less than fifty»

percent of his kicks, the job of kick-
er has to be up for grabs. ‘If you
think kicking isn’t important,
remember this year’s home loss to
Notre Dame? '

No. 7: Sign on the dottedline.
J Penn Hills and Elite ll quarter-
back Anthony Morelli and North

Hills running back Andrew Johnson

have both given the Panthers their

verbal commitment, but with sign-
ing day less then a month away,
both players have had second
thoughts. If both decide to stick it
out with the Panthers, and Walt
Harris can land current Panther Sam
Bryant’s brother James from
Reading, Pa., at linebacker, Pitt will
put together a very solid recruiting
class.

No. 6: Run or pass? That is the
question. ' '
.When Miree washealthy this

year, the Panthers ran. When he
wasn’t, they passed. Next" year,
whether it is Tyler Palko, Luke
Getsy or Morelli handing the ball to
J awan Walker, Raymond Kirkley or
Johnson, all of them will be
unproven. So, coach, will you run
or will youthrow?

No. 5: Opening the holes.

After guard Brian Anderson
graduated and injuries hindered
who was left, on the offensive line,
Rutherford fought pressure, and
Miree and Walker were forced much

~ of the time to make their own holes.

Next year, the only real proven line-
man the Panthers will have will be
tackle Rob Petitti. Who will line up
next to him?

No. 4: A case of the Joneses and a
Wilson.

Pitt students and fans got to
watch firsthand as Kevin Jones and
Julius Jones ran through, over and
around the Panther defense. Then
they watched on ESPN as Quincy
Wilson did the same thing. So with
Lewis Moore, their leading tackler,
graduating along with a few other

Taylor and Kincaid record
double doubles in victory

Women’s basketball, page 17

The higher percentage was a key
to victory for the Panthers, who led
by at least 10 points for most of the
second half.

When the Friars tried to climb
back into the game, Allen would hit
a three-pointer and put the Panthers
up by 13. _

Allen started the Panthers’ run
by hitting a three—pointer with 17: 13
left in the second half to put Pitt up
31-24.

Pitt continued the run when
Kincaid hit the first of her two free
throws and missed the second. The
rebound from the second went into

the hands of forward Sheila Stufﬂet,
who put the ball in the basket for a
quick two points.

Pitt was now up by 10 points
and would never look back.

“I thought that, today, the team
came out, and they really did com-
pete,” Berenato said, comparing
Pitt’s efforts against Providence to
its effort in its previous game
against Syracuse.

According to Berenato, Pitt
dominated on the boards, and the
stats would back her statement 100
percent. Pitt outrebounded
Providence 45-19 and held the
Friars to only three offensive
rebounds in the entire game.

the second half. Darius Rice, who had a game-
high 22 points, also played well on defense, get-
ting a steal and setting up Robert Hite for a fast-
break layup to give the Hurricanes the lead back
at 47-45 with 11 minutes left in the game.

The Hurricanes continued shooting well,
extending their lead to six with seven minutes
remaining. Pitt tried to chip away on the strength
of six points by Krauser.

Krauser hit four free throws down the
stretch, along with hitting a layup to cut the
Miami lead to one with fewer than three minutes
left.

“These guys are winners,’ Dixon said.
“When things aren’t going great, they still have
confidence in themselves. Especially when
[Miami] was making the shots they were mak-
ing ”

i

As the clock ticked down to less than two
minutes, Miami looked to Diaz to try and seal
the game. He hit a big jump shot to give the
Hurricanes back a three—point lead. -

Both teams held their ground defensively and
the Panthers found the ball in their hands with 30
seconds remaining, down by three. Page, who
only had five second-half points, hit a big three-
pointer from the corner to tie the game at 62.

Once again, Miami went to their go—to guy,
and Diaz hit a fade-away bank shot over Jaron
Brown to put Miami back on top with 3.9 sec-
onds left. After a timeout, Krauser got the
inbounds pass and sent the game to overtime on
a length-of-the—court drive and layup to tie the
game at 64.

“That’s a play we practice everyday,” Dixon
said. “All five guys did what they were supposed
to do.”

In the first overtime, both teams traded buck-
ets. With the score tied at 68, Brown hit a jump
shot with 30 seconds left to give Pitt a 70-68
lead. Again, Miami turned to Diaz, but this time,

JESSE‘

he was unsuccessful in hitting the shot that
would have tied up the game, ‘and the Hurricanes‘
were forced to foul Mark McCarroll.

After McCarroll hit one of two free throws,
Diaz got a second chance toitie up the game, and
this time, he hit
the shot to tie
the score at 71
and send the
game into dou-
ble overtime.

“I felt like
Miami was
making some
tough shots,”
Dixon said.
“They played
well enough to
win. We did so
many things in
the game that
told us we
p r o b a b 1 y
shouldn’t win.”

In the sec-
ond overtime,
once again both

teams would
trade scores.
With the game
tied at 77,

T r o u t m a 11
found Taft open ,
under the bas-
ket for an easy

layup, which
gave the
Panthers a 79-
77 lead. As
Miami drove
down the court,
Brown

picked off of his

man and was forced into a mismatch.

But Brown read Armondo Surratt’s eyes,
stole the ensuing pass, and got fouled in the
process. Brown would hit both free throws, and

the Panthers would continue their perfect season.
