Compensation committee sets

raises for chancellor, faculty, staff  

J_. ELIZABETH STROHM
News Editor g ‘.

The compensation committee of
Pitt’s board of trustees met Dec. 16,
approving a 3 percent increase in
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg’s 2003-
04 salary, between 3 and 4 percent
salary increases for five other ‘Pitt
officers, and a 2 to 2.5 percent salary
increase for Pitt’s faculty. ‘

For Nordenberg, the increase will
bring in‘ an extra $11,500 each year,
raising his annual salary to $401,500.
The money given in raises to all staff,

for the University amounts to $8.1
million, according to Vice Chancellor
for Public Affairs Robert Hill.

Hill ‘explained that the board
approved a 3 percent salary increase
pool last October. In the end,‘ that
salary increase-pool led to a 2 percent
increase in salaries for all faculty and
staff members who had given a satis-

factory performance, (with an addi- ’
tional .5 percent increase awarded for 1
,, merit. ’ - ‘

The decisions regarding raises
came nearly‘ a year after the board

Loss in close

   Bowl sums up  
Panthers’ season

RYAN FALooN
Staff Writer

CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The result of the
‘Continental Tire Bowl was a good summary" for
the 2003 Pitt football team —' close, but not
enough. i

The Panthers (8-5 overall, 5-2 conference)
came up short once again, losing another close
game to Virginia,‘ 23-16, in the final game of

_ their disappointing season.

Things looked promising in the opening min-
utes for the underdog Panthers, but an impres-
sive stop by the Cavalier defense on their own 3-
yard line kept Pitt’s explosive offense out of the
end zone. -

“The difference between winning and losing
is three or four plays here and there,” Pitt head
coach Walt Harris said. “We thought we scored
on one run down there and we thought we could
get it in there, but_ we didn’t get the right execu-
tion at that time.”

Construction will make
Cathedral a cooler place

LAURA JERPI .
Staff Writer

Don’t sweat it — the construc-
tion in the Cathedral of Learning
will have a cool effect.

The new addition of strategical-
ly placed temporary partition walls
on the second and third ﬂoors of the
Cathedral of Learning is making it
quite difficult to get around these
days. According to a facilities man-
agement report, a $20 million reno-
vation project funded by the state
started at the beginning of the
month in the Cathedral.

The renovation involves
installing forced air ventilation, air
conditioning, temperature controls
and sprinklers, and updating the
electrical system in 49 classrooms
andvarious offices located on the

two floors.

This project will be completed
in two separate phases. The first
part involves the renovation of the
second- and third—ﬂoor classrooms
on the Bellefield Avenue side of the
Cathedral. The second part of reno-
vations includes the classrooms on
the Bigelow Boulevard side.

In addition, the air conditioning
and fire sprinkler protection sys-
tems on floors seven through nine
will be replaced.

The temporary partition walls
were constructed to help isolate the
construction work ‘from the public.
To keep noise ‘to a minimum, most
of the necessary, noisy, demolishing
work will be done between 11 p-.m.
and 7 a.m.

The construction should be

completed by December 2004.

Many find raise fair, still decry low pay and high tuition

Raises, page 1

created controversy by approving a 14 percent
salary increase for the chancellor during a period
when the cost of tuition, which had also risen 14
percent that year, was rapidly increasing.

The response to the raises this year is markedly
different from last year, when the Faculty Assembly
passed a resolution criticizing the trustees’ decision
to give such a largeraise to the chancellor and other
officials. In their.March 2003 resolution, the assem-
bly encouraged the trustees to “give greater heed to
the chancellor’s concern” that such large raises for
officers could hurt their relationships with students,
as well as with the faculty and staff, who received a
3.5 percent salary increase last year.

“The 3 percent raises were in line with what
other faculty and staff got. That’s clearly appropri-
ate,” said John Baker, a faculty member who sits on
both the Faculty Assembly and the Senate Council.
Baker drafted the resolution that criticized the
trustees last year, though he emphasized that he did
not find fault with the chancellor for his raise last
year.

“I agreed with the trustees’ evaluation that he’d
done a good job and deserved a merit raise,” Baker
said, “but a lot of other faculty deserve one, too.”

“I think [the raise] is much more appropriate
this year,” Baker added, though he pointed out that
“3 percent goes a lot farther when you’re earning
$400,000,” compared to the salaries of most facul-
ty and staff members. 9 .

“I would assume most students think
[Nordenberg’s] done a good job, too,” Baker said.

 

DO VOU HAVE A COLD?

If you answered YES to this question, call
immediately as soon as your cold symptoms

start!

If you are age 18 to 50 and call when your cold
symptoms start, you may be eligible to participate
in a research study in the North Pittsburgh area.

“He really is a genuine person, and he cares about
the University.” -

Richard Colwell, the president of Pitt’s Staff
Association Council, offered a similar response.

“I haven’t heard anything from the staff regard-
ing the upper administrators’ annual increases,”
Colwell said in a written statement. “The chancel-

‘fF0r many staﬁ‘, as I’ to,
3 . percent annual raise
will not oﬂset. the
increase in health care
or their costs of living. ”

Richard Colwell
President, Staﬁ Association Council at Pitt

lor receiving a 3 percent raise is very much inline
with the rest of [those of] the University communi-
ty who performed meritoriously.”

But Colwell, like Baker, mentioned that a 3 per-
cent raise would mean something different to facul-
ty and staff, compared to the chancellor.

“For many staff, a 1 to 3 percent annual raise
will not offset the increase in health care or their
costs of living,” he said, adding that the Staff

Association Council will try to put together a “more
substantial” proposal for the annual increases next
year, as the economy allows.

Not all members of the faculty and staff were

. satisfied with this year’s salary increases. Geoff

Bonina, a staff association council member and
English department Web master, was unsatisﬁed
that University officers received larger increases
than faculty and staff members.

“I think if there were going to be raises in gen-
eral, they should be ﬂat across the board,’-’ Bonina
said.

‘.‘I don’t feel that, any year there’s a tuition’

increase, there should be any ’ increase A in
[Nordenberg’s] ‘salary, especially when it’s more
than the staff [receives],” Bonina said, explaining
that he believes the chancellor is largely responsi-
ble for seeking state funding and gathering enough
money to prevent tuition costs from growing.

“I think that Mark Nordenberg deserves a bonus
most when he cuts tuition, or keeps it even, or when
he’s ﬁnding _creative sources for more money, or
when he does a good ‘job balancing the budget,”

Bonina said. ‘

Baker also suggested that Pennsylvania’s gov-
ernment, as ‘well as the state’s citizens, should ‘give
more support to higher education, though he placed

the responsibility for raising‘ that money on the peo-

ple of Pennsylvania. 1

“It was pretty inexpensive to go through college
when I went to school, and I really do feel for the
students,” Baker said, expressing his dislike of the
9.5 percent tuition increase that students facedthis
year.

THE PITT NEWS

Party Web site puts the word out for events, clubs, specials

Party, page 1

By including businesses and
events outside of Oakland on his
site, Chu hopes to reach out to col-
lege students and young adults
throughout the city.

Since he began his project, Chu
has been joined by Tamer Ali,
Danny 'Zhu and Ron Watson.
Counting the four of them and the
street team ‘they use to promote
events, there are about 10 people on
the staff. e

“We just try to make the life of
going out much simpler,” Chu said.

‘Not only does the Web site offer
free advertising for house parties
and clubson the site, but it also
contracts out DJs and provides
prizes, including DVD players and
bar kits, at clubs. The prizes are an
incentive for students and other
people. to" go out, especially now
that it is getting cold outside, he

‘ said. '

Since_the site is still relatively

' new, Chu calls local places and asks
' the management if they would like

some free advertising on his site.
Then he visits the place to get a feel

. for it and to take pictures to put up

on the site. After becoming familiar
with the place, he writes a review to

Congratulations to the

_add to the site as well, and he asks

the management if they would like
to have a PittPartyCentral night.

The ‘site also offers visitors
coupons and various discounts to
city bars and clubs.

As a freshman, Chu was sur-
prised that a bar and party directory
site similar to the one he eventually
set up wasn’t already available.

“We’re not Penn State, where

everything just circulates around,”

he said. 7
Since creating the site, Chu has
gotten feedback from people at
many schools — including Indiana
University of Pennsylvania,

Pennsylvania State ‘University and
even a school in Louisiana —— want-
ing similar sites to help create “a
party community” at their schools.

“Our primary goal is to encour-
age more of a growth in the party
community around here,” he said.
“You come to school to learn, but
you don’t learn everything in class.
Be sure to “have a good time out
here.”

This Saturday, PittPartyCentral
will be at Rumshakers in the South
Side. The Web site’s DJs Nate
Delong  aka DJ Detonate —— and
Sasan will be featured. There is a $2
surcharge.

US-VISIT program unfairly applied

Certain (foreign visitors to the
United States will now have their
fingerprints and pictures taken, in an
operation that the Department of
Homeland Security hopes will
improve monitoring of who enters
and leaves the country.

But this operation, dubbed US-
VISIT, does not apply to all travel-
ers.

Those from Japan, Singapore,
Australia, New Zealand and Western
Europe — yes, even France — who
visit will not be fingerprinted or
photographed.

This only applies until October,
when those countries must certify
that they have appropriate tracking
systems of biometrics, according to
a Homeland Security Questionand
Answer sheet.

But why make such distinctions?
If the United States is going to col-
lect and record such data, ostensibly
in the interest of national security, it
should do so indiscriminately.

The program, which cost $710
million and was mandated in 2000,
was designed to track air and sea
travel.

And, in this age of mercurial
appearances and identity theft, fin-
gerprinting is necessary to ensure
proper identification.

Moreover, as The Washington
Post reported Jan. 6, whatever com-
plaints travelers have about the new

system, the process does not seem to
be delaying air travel or overly
inconveniencing. anyone. .

A quick press of a finger to glas
and a glamorous, driver’s license-
style digital photo take less time
than removing shoes, passing
through .metal detectors or ‘going
through the other security proce-
dures. ‘ V

Still, fingerprinting select

groups, while permitting others to
receive waivers from the program,
creates loopholes and engenders
hostility from slighted countries.
A Already, a Brazilian judge ruled
that all U.S. citizens entering Brazil
wouldbe subject to the same proce-
dures.

Parity dictates that American
visitors should submit their biomet-
rics with little grumbling, consider-
ing the process takes about 15 sec-
onds.

Other countries may follow
Brazi1’s example, in order to sym-
bolically spite the United States for
favoring Singapore over, say, those
countries that do not actively.perse-
cute Jehovah’s Witnesses or cane
criminals. -

In the interest of repairing the

United States’ relationship with
three entire continents, US—VISIT
should be an all-or-nothing program
— either record this information uni-
formly or don’t record any at all. .

Be acolumnist; enjoy fame, bubblegum

Did you know that The Pitt News is part
of a vast media conspiracy?

'Ihat’s right; your beloved daily news-
paper is created in a secret underground lab
in Milwaukee with a cutting-edge Computer
system that ensures all pieces in the paper
meet a highly classiﬁed and arbitrary set of
editorial criteria 4

The lab, which has a lot of ﬂashing but-
tons and switches to ﬂip — or so I’ve heard;

, I’ve never been there —— works on the prin-

ciple that inﬁnite monkeys, given inﬁnite
time and inﬁnite typewriters, can produce
Shakespeare. Although, as we
all know, thanks to late-night
talk show hosts, an experiment
recently disproved that. The
monkeys mostly ﬂung poo and
“s” key a lot.

So what it comes down to is
that The Pitt News is a totally
randomized bunch of words
created by elite scientists, mon-
keys and ﬂashing buttons, in
Milwaukee. ’

Or maybe not.

Maybe The Pitt News. is
written by a dedicated and talented group of
aspiring journalists who love what they do.
Maybe it’s written by students studying writ-
ing or journalism, or biology or theatre.

 

‘Perhaps they are freshmen, or super-duper
seniors. They may dream about Arm

Coulter, or about Al Franken. . Or Ann
Coulter and Al Franken, though I don’t rec-
ommend thinking about that, Your head is
liable to explode. .

WhatI’m getting athere is this: The Pitt
News is the independent student newspaper
at the University of Pittsburgh, and that is a
beautiful thing. We truly are independent,
with a wonderfully capable business staff
(who are also students) that provides our rev-
enue through advertising. We are a student
paper in the truest sense of the word, written
and edited entirely by students.

one that isn’t available at every school

around. Lots of “student” papers are funded»

by the school, and so have to tailor their con-
tent to the views of the administration, or are

edited by faculty members. Others are week- ‘

ly, so by the time you get the chance to com-
ment on Britney Spears’ joyous nuptial bliss,
the wedding’s been armulled.

Also, we are hiring, like we do every
term, and tl1at’s anoﬂter giant difference

between us and just about every other news-

paper on the face of the planet.
Want a piece of the action?
I’m inviting you to ﬁnd

up in application and see
what all of the buzz is about
We work hard and we play

For this section,‘ the

you’ll be assigned either a
weekly or biweekly deadline, have your pic-

Please put me on the NRA blacklist that targets Getty, ACLU

Dear National Riﬂe Association,
Please put me on your super-

duper blacklist, which details any--
one and everyone that has ever “lent-

monetary, grassroots or some other
type‘ of direct support to anti-gun
organizations,” as your Web site

'says.

I will love you forever, and
promise not to laugh when Charlton
Heston anachronistically quotes
Judah Maccabee in “The Ten
Commandments,” if you do me this
one_teensy favor.

Thank you,

Sydney Bergman

The NRA’s Institute for
Legislative Action — the lobbying
arm of the NRA, an organization
dedicated to preventing what’ it sees
as infringements upon the Second
Amendment and what others see as
promoting a pro—gun agenda — has
compiled a blacklist naming organi-
zations, celebrities, companies and
media outlets devoted to gun control
legislation.

It’s quite an impressive list, as
blacklists go. And when I first read
through it, my initial reaction was to
ask if this was a joke.

The list, which can be found at
www.nraila.org/Issues/FactSheets/R
ead.aspx?ID=l5, includes such
known radical organizations as the
American Association of
Ambulatory Care Nursing, and such

firebrands as actress Estelle Getty.

That’s right — the NRA has
blacklisted Sophia from “The
Golden Girls.”

But this list, apparently, is not a
joke, hoax or parody. As The Seattle
Times’ Nicole Brodeur wrote on
Nov. 4, 2003, she found that NRA
members, knew of its
existence, though the
ones she interviewed did-
n’t seem to _take it too
seriously.

One even posited that
he would only be afraid
of the people on the list if
one came after him with a
hammer. (Though, I must
say, being, anti-gun does
not necessarily mean
being anti-‘backhoe or -

no such things as gray-lists or

even _“my political views are nascent

for the moment, I question the pur-

would tell him about the Us and the
Them.

In this case, the Them included

people with education and fairly

~ radical political beliefs, who valued

the arts and didn’t use the phrase
“liberal media conspiracy.”

He said, from that point on, he
dedicated his life to escaping the Us
and becoming one of the relatively
demonized Them, which he has.

So, upon reading the_NRA’s list,
I resolved to become one of the

Them — a person of enough note to
be worth blacklisting.

It’s extraordinary narcissism, I
know. Plus, wanting to see my name
next to those of Jimmy Breslin and
Art Buchwald has always been a
secret fantasy.

And it’s also because I question
the constant flogging of the Second
Amendment by people who have not
read the Supreme Court’s decision
on the case of United States vs.
Miller — the last substantive rein-
terpretation of the Second
Amendment — in the same way I
question the constant flogging of
certain verses in Leviticus by those
who haven’t read the laterrabbinic
interpretations of biblical cleansing
laws.

I have neither the time nor the
space for an extended discussion
here.

Gun control, that great political
bear-trap, cannot be addressed in
these few short lines. But if anyone
at the NRA is reading this — and I
hope you are — please put me on
your blacklist.

This Canadian pop punker ain’t Avril

ASHLEY MCGUIRE
Assistant A&E Editor

Normally, when you A answer a
ringing phone, you get a “Hello, how
are you?” I got a greeting from Fefe
Dobson’s agent, asking if I was
ready for the interview. Not your
typical phone call, but not one where
you were dying to get off the line,
either.

The Toronto-native, 18-year-old
punk pop singer may just give Avril
Lavigne some competition this year.
As written in The New York Daily
News, “Move over Avril,” may be
just the phrase, though Dobson does-
n’t give the impres-'
sion of recognizing

“I’m fine with my feelings out
and people knowing what I’m all
about. I think that’s why it’s on a
record,” Dobson said. .

Leaving high school to be signed

with Island Records nearly nine.

months ago has kept Dobson busy.
Being so occupied, you wonder how
the girl could possibly have time to
accessorize. Since already in this
short amount of time, Dobson has
appeared in countless interviews in
magazines such-as Vanity Fair and
Teen People, along with her debut on
MTV’s TRL. It makesa person won-
der what sort of competition is in
store for Avril. Perhaps another

her own talent,
keeping her head
straight on her jew-
eled, sometimes
scarf—embellished
neck.

One thing is for
certain. The girl’s
got style, both in
her dress and voice.
Although articles
often note Dobson
and Lavigne’s simi-
lar tastes in the
punk/alternative
category, the com-
parisons usually
end there. Her lyrics
are a bit deeper and
more personal than
Avril’s “Sk8tr Boi”
track, and her
answers to my ques-
tions

soon. Dobson speaks highly of her
fellow Canadian, but then, again,
didn’t Spears and Aguilera start off
as friends? However, while Spears
and Aguilera seem similar in both
their sex kitten appearances and
music, MTV.com noted about
Dobson and Avril that: “The differ-
ences between the two are more
apparent in the music.. While Avril
channels her inner Sum 41, Dobson
was raised on grunge.” ,
As Dobson put it: “I think we’re
totally different, and we both agree
with that — Avril and 1. Our music’s
different. «Our sound’s different.
We’re just two, Canadian, young

have obsessions with Judy Garland
and Sid and Nancy.” I have weird
obsessions with these people. I think
it’s just that they speak to me in an
odd way, and, you know, maybe I
feel that they’re kind of misunder-
stood in a way. And I feel some-
times, like, in my own personal life,
like by rriy family, or whatever, I’m
kind of misunderstood. But, I don’t
know, I just think that their music is
so genius and they’re such charac-
ters.”

The question is, then, how do
you go from Judy Garland to punk?
Maybe, playing the leading role of
Dorothy in “The Wizard of Oz,” a

could have

something to

Listening to
Dobson’s debut CD,
released on Dec. 9,
is like reading diary
entries to her life

experiences. The
sultry, hard-edged
tune “Bye Bye

Boyfriend”, and the emotionally dri-
ven track “Unforgiven,” an ode to
the father that walked out of her life
years ago, lead the listener to believe
that Dobson is not shy about expos-

Hoobastank’ s latest  
tops debut release  

The Reason
Hoobastank

Island Records
i‘r‘2i‘r‘7i\'

With harder guitars and vocals
that soar with harmony as well as
angst, the members of Hoobastank
takes another step towards remov-
ing themselves from the label of
“imitation Incubus” that has haunt-
ed them since their start.

The follow up to their platinum,
self—titled debut, The Reason has
songs to rock to, including the first
single, “Out of Control,” which is
getting more than its fair share of
airtime on radio and television.

Along with the heavy songs that
drive the Hoobastank faithful to
raging mosh pits are the softer
tracks that shine a light on a more
emotional side, a side that doesn’t
need a loud, throat—tearing scream
to be moving.

The overall sound of The
Reason blows their debut out of the
water with powerful lyrics and
vocal harmonies, along with a dri-

ving [rock sound that has
grownup since the release of
their first album in 2001. A

“Same Direction” opens *
the album with «a powerful ,
punch, a stronggright hook
that is followed byithe upper-
cut track of ,“Out of Control.”
Both tracksshare the [common
theme‘ of -religion; _;ala_ck of it
and not understanding the
need for it when there are so
many holes in the reasoning. '

The chorus in. “Same
Direction” questions who’s
wrong and who’s right. “But
I’m not ever going to know if
I’m right or wrong/ ‘cause
we’re all going in the same
direction/ and I’m not sure
which way to go because all
along/ we’ve been going in
the same direction.”

The album’s title track is

one of the softer cuts, filled
with beautiful lyrics and a
soaring vocal line, an apologetic
love song that fits in perfectly. “I
found a reason for me, to change

who I used to be/ a reason to start ‘

I

over new, and the reason is you”
The Reason balances itself on

both the hard and more emotional

sides of the road. But the album

definitely travels the harder side of
the road more, and drives with
power all the way through..

The boys of Blink 182 getpast the crude jokes and grow up

4 .a............ ..

Blink 182
Blink 182
Geffen Records
s2n2r<.“r1/2

This isn’t the Blink 182 -that you
may be used to. The boys have
matured. Well, musically anyway.

Their latest release, which is self-
titled, sports a more grown-up sound.
Gone are the songs about enemas and
farts. And don’t expect a video of the
band running around naked to air on
MTV anytime soon. None of the
songs on this album warrant that.

This release is a huge step in the
direction that Blink 182 has taken
their entire career, a more mature
sound that can help pull in listeners
that may not have a taste for the
songs about enemas and partying
with their pants down.

Yes, Blink has done the serious
songs in their past — “Adam’s‘ Song”
their anti-suicide song from the
Enema of the State album, which got
ﬂak from people because they
thought it was a song about suicide,
is an example. But they’ve never

done serious songs about desperation

\ . .«-u ..a....'—- .u:—.-v~.u.-»u.—u'-.v\.np. u-.u-I-up-. (v.w..............\

“.1”

, and love. Don’t worry, though; it’s

not sappy.

‘The songs about desperation and
love are done the way only Blink can
do them, with the edgy, California
punk rock style that they bring to the
table with every release.

, “I- Miss You” is a hauntingly
beautiful song that features both
Mark Hoppus and TomDeLonge
singing the chorus, asking, “Don’t
waste your time on me; you’re
already the voice inside my head. I
miss you. I miss you.”

“Stockholm Syndrome” starts
with a piano playing behind a woman
who is reading a "letter that Mark’s
grandfather wrote to his wife when he
was in World War II, the kind of let-
ter that dealt with the missing and
wanting of love in a time of despera-
tion. Then the song grows into a pow-
erful track about paranoia.

A new perspective on life; along
with several years in the business,
has brought a great new sound to the
shelves of record stores for Blink
182. Their most recent release is a
new sound for Blink and hopefully
for a few new listeners as well.

Nelly Furtado ﬂexes her many
musical inﬂuences on latest

Folklore

Nelly Furtado
Dreamworks Records
i‘m“ri‘r

You might have heard Nelly
Furtado’s hit tracks “I’m Like a
Bird,” and “Turn off the Lights,”
from her debut album, and if you
didn’t, you must not listen to the
radio or watch television.

Furtado burst onto the music
scene in 2000 with her debut
release, Whoa Nelly.’ Almost
overnight, she was a household
name and suddenly there were two
Nellys in the music business.

Her mu1ti—platinum debut is a
tough act to follow. A very tough
act, in fact, as she had several tracks
from the debut album climb the
Billboard charts.

This time around, Furtado has
chosen to mix it up a bit. She cross-

to acoustic guitar to folk music and
even a little bluegrass. Furtado isn’t
afraid to play what she feels, and
with her interests being as diverse
as Jeff Buckley and Smashing
Pumpkins, as well as numerous oth-
ers, she feels quite a lot.

The first single from Folklore,
“Powerless (Say What You Want),”
has a twangy folk feel with a ringing
acoustic guitar mixed with funky
hip—hop beats. “Cuz this life is too
short to live it just for you/ But
when yougfeel so powerless, what
are you gonna do/ so say what you
want.”

“Try” is a beautiful song with an
acoustic guitar opening, and as the
song develops, more instruments
mix in, including scratches from a
DJ and drums. Furtado’s angelic
voice rings high above the musical
accompaniment. “Then I see you
standing there/ Wanting more from

es more boundaries than most artists
do during the entire span of their
careers, and on only one album. She
combines everything from hip—hop

me/ And all I can do is try.”

Like with her debut album,
every track on Folklore is different.
She takes funky hip—hop and fuses it

with acoustic and electric guitars.
Some songs have the sweet har-
monies and beautiful voice of for any dance party.
Furtado, fitting for a quiet night

with that special someone or alone,

15-0.’

DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA/CONTRIBUTING EDITOR

Toree Morris puts the ﬁnishing touch on a basket during last night’s 78-59 win over Virginia Tech on 'll1esday night. The Panthers improved to a perfect 15-0 and
extended their home ‘winning streak to 35 games, ‘dating back to the 2001-2002 season.

Panthers continue to roll with win over Hokies

JOE MARCHILENA
Sports Editor

Solid defense and high-percent-S

age shots. That’s the Panthers’ formu-

la for winning games, and so far this

season, it’s working. _
Pitt improved to 15-0 behind a

career-high 21 points from Jaron

Brown, knocking off Virginia Tech
78-59 in the Big East opener for both
teams. Brown was 10-of-15 shooting
and scored the 1,000th point of his
career, becoming the 31st player to
reach that’ mark in Pitt history.

The Panthers forced Virginia

Tech to turn theiball over 26 times,
including 15 turnovers in the second
half, and held the Hokies to less than
50 percent shooting from the field.

“I thought we executed, well,
especially in the defensive end,” said
Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon. “We
were able to force turnovers against a
team with talented players.”

Julius Page shook off a poor
shooting night against William and
Mary on Saturday to add 20 points,
and center Chris Taft chipped in with
a career-high 17 points in his first
conference game.

Bryant Matthews led all scorers

with 22 points, but also had a game-
high nine turnovers for-the Hokies.

“You can’t beat yourself, and we
did a pretty good job of that,”
Virginia Tech head coach Seth
Greenberg said. “They’re a very good
team. They’ve got that toughness
about them; they have depth in the
front court.”

Taft got the Panthers on the board
first, scoring five points to help give
Pitt a 7-2 lead. Zabian Dowdell
helped keep the Hokies in the game,
hitting three baskets from behind the
three-point line to lead Virginia Tech
on a 12-4 run and help the Hokies

take a 22~18 lead with 10:55 left in
the half.

Pitt came right back, scoring
nine of the final 16 points of the half,
including Brown’s milestone basket,

.to end the half with a 39-33 lead.

After receiving a pass from Taft,
Brown drove down the middle of the
lane and pulled up for a quick jump
shot —— a move that has become a sta-
ple in Brown’s repertoire.

“He was able to get to the middle
of the ‘floor and get separation,”
Greenberg said. “He’s a good player.

Panthers pick up three
victories‘ during break

BRIAN GOLDMAN
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball
team played seven games over win-
ter break, including its Big East
conference opener against West
Virginia. The Panthers won three of
the seven games with victories over
Norfolk State, Robert Morris and an
upset victory over Fordham.
Pittsburgh is now 4-7 on the season
and 0-1 in conference play.

Despite, the 3-4 record over the

past seven games, there was one i

major setback to the Panther roster.
Pitt lost its team leader in a practice
before the game against Penn State;
starting point. guard Amy Kunich
went down with a stress fracture in
her left foot. She is expected to be
out until at least late January. T

Kunich was the only returning
starter on the Panthers roster. Stacy
Moore has been starting in place of
the injured Kunich. I

The team’s second conference
game is tonight at 7:00 in the
Petersen Events Center against
Syracuse. .

“I don’t know if I would have
said we would have four wins by
Jan. 6,” head coach Agnus Berenato
said. “I probably would have said
one win. I’m' pleased- we’ve had
victories. Our best win was

Fordham; it inspired the team. We‘
had a phenomenal effort at West"

Virginiaeven though we lost. We’re
missing playing experience,‘but I

» have a lot of hope.”

No. 7 Penn State 96, Pitt 44 -g ’

With the Panthers coming off of '

their .only win ever in this series
one year ago, the Nittany Lions
avenged last year’s loss with their
biggest margin of victory ever in
the 15-game series. Kelly Mazzante
had a game-high 31 for Penn State,
while Latoya Kincaid led Pitt with
16 points.

Pitt 64, Norfolk State 44

Behind Jessica Allen and
Kincaid’s 17 points, the Panthers
rebounded from their loss to Penn
State with a strong defensive and
shooting performance against
Norfolk State. Pitt shot 19-of—2l
from the free throw line, while
recording 17 steals on defense.
Jennifer Brown also recorded her
first career doi1ble—double with 13
points and 11 rebounds.

Pitt 61, Robert Morris 47

Pitt put together its first two-
game winning streak of the season
and recorded its 21st consecutive

victory over Robert Morris. Sheila

Stufflet led the Panthers with a
career-high 16 points, while Allen
had 15 and Kincaid had 12 points.
Pitt shot 50 percent (7—for-14) from
beyond the arc, and used a 13-2 run
to open the second half to seal its
third victory of the season.

Clemson 62, Pitt 47
Playing their third game in five
days, the Panthers showed fatigue,

‘making’ only 27 percent of their A

shots from the field. Pitt played the
Tigers to a 27-27 tie at halftime, but
Clemson pulled away in the second
half. Brown had a team-high 16
points and 13 rebounds, while
Kincaid had nine points and 10
rebounds. '

Xavier 72, Pitt 48

Again, poor shooting hurt the
Panthers who didn’t score for over
a 10-minute stretch in the first half.
Meanwhile, Xavier came out on
fire, hitting 62 percent of its shots
from the field. Kincaid once again
led the Panthers with 16 points and
nine rebounds, while Brown had 14
points and seven rebounds.

Pitt 62, Fordham 48

Playing on New Year’s Eve, Pitt
handed Fordham its first loss in its
last six games. Again, Kincaid led
the way with another doub1e—double
—, 13 points, 12 rebounds —— while

.- Brown finishediwith 11 points and

eight rebounds- . .

‘The Panthers held a slim 30-23
halftime lead, but were able to pull
away in the second half thanks in
part to Fordham shooting only 28
percent from the field. Allen also
chipped in with 10 points.

West Virginia 65, Pitt 58

The Mountaineers came out fir-
ing in the game, scoring the first 16
points. Pitt rallied back‘ behind
three three-pointers from Allen to
knot the game at 32 at halftime.

A Brooke Hughes jumper gave

the Panthers their first lead of the

game 13 seconds into the second
half. With the game tied at 51 with
five minutes remaining, West
Virginia went on a game-winning 9:
0 run. , .

Cheron Taylor led the way for
Pitt, scoring‘ a career-high 13
points. Allen had 12 points, while

‘Kincaid added 11.

Fitzgerald finishes second
in race for the Heisman

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

NEW YORK — The fact that
Panther wideout Larry Fitzgerald left
New York City without the Heisman
Trophy does not mean he returned to
Pittsburgh with hands empty.

He left the Yale Club as the only

sophomore to win three out of the six ~

voting regions and left with the satis-
faction of just being there to enjoy
the moment. As Michigan running
back Chris Perry said, it was just
great to be in New York.

“I knew I wasn’t going to [win],
so I was just happy [to be there]. I’m
enjoying myself,” Perry said,
adding, with a smile, “I’m in New
York!”

Perry also spoke highly of
Fitzgerald, as did the other two can-
didates, including the winner, Jason
White, quarterback of Oklahoma,
who, when the envelope was being
torn open, thought Fitzgerald was
going to -win. . ’ ,

3 “I thought Larry was going to
win it,” White ‘said. “I think he’s an
outstanding. athlete.”

White was not the only one to

think Fitzgerald is an outstanding
athlete; many Heisman voters felt
Fitzgerald was deserving of college
football’s greatest individual award.

Fitzgerald received 253 first-
place votes, 233 second-place votes
and 128 third-place votes. He fin-

‘ ished with a total of 1,353 points,

just 128 points shy of White.
Fitzgerald won the Northeast,
Mid-Atlantic and the Midwest
regions, and came in second in the
Southwest and the Far West regions.
“When I saw [the total scores] on
the screen, I said ‘Man, I was pretty
close,”’ Fitzgerald said, smiling.
_Where Fitzgerald essentially lost
the Heisman was in the South region,
which consists of the states
Kentucky, Tennessee, Louisiana,
Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and
Florida. In this particular region, he
came in third place, behind White

and Mississippi. _ quarterback ,El_i

Pitt wins Beast of the East title

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

The Pitt wrestling team partici-
pated in two tournaments over the
winter break and had polar opposite
results. -

Pitt (2-1) placed first out of 20
teams competing in the Beast of the
East Tournament with 126.5 points,
while the Panthers scored only 14.5
points in the annual Midland Open,
finishing tied for 30th.

The Beast of the East
Tournament was held on Dec. 19 in
Newark, Del. Pitt had eight players
finish in the top four in their weight
classes in the tournament, including
two players placing first in their
weight class. *

Senior Josh Birt won all four of
his matches to take first in his class.
His four wins improved’ his. season
record to .10-2. . ' ' — .

. Also placing ‘first in this weight
class was junior Zachariah Doll. He
remained undefeated for the season,
with five. wins in the 165-pound
weight class, including a win over

the No. 1 seed.from Northwestern,

Matt Delguyd. . .

Senior Travis Shirley went 4-2
and won his quarterfinal match over
Ryan Adams of North Carolina to
finish in fourth place.

The Annual. Midlands Open on
the campus of Northwestern on Dec.

-29 and 30 was a different story for

the Panthers. Many of the wrestlers
had not seen a mat in eight days,
and that ‘made it tough for the

Panthers in what is ‘considered as-

tough tournament. '

Nestor led the Panthers in the
tournament. with four victories in
six matches, including two falls.
With that, he improved his season

the most outstanding player, not team

MAR   ENNS

NEW YORK .-—- All season long, it
seemed like Larry Fitzgerald was a
long shot to win the Heisman
Trophy, and the reasons were
repeated over and over again.

Only three wide receivers have
ever taken home the most presti-
gious award in college football, and
they all returned punts as well. And
of the 68 previous winners, none
was a sophomore.

But in the end, it wasn’t either
of those that kept Fitzgerald from
becoming just the second Panther to
win the trophy. The problem was his
team. *

Not since 1987, ‘when Tim
Brown --
receivers, by the way — won the
Heisman with an 8-4 Notre Dame
squad had a player from a team with
more than three losses won the
award; . y ’

, While it _doesn’t seem right, that
the performance of a player’s team
would hurt his chance of being con-
sidered the ‘best player in college
football, the requirements for the
Heisman don.’ t state that it shouldn’t
be taken into‘ consideration.

In’ fact, the only criterion that
Heisman voters are given is to vote
for the “most outstanding player in
college football.” *

What determines outstanding? Is
it a player’s‘ athletic ability that
makes him outstanding, or is it the
numbers he puts up? Is it even just
that one player’s performance all

season, or is it combined with his

team’s performance, too?

In this case, it’s the player and
his team.

Both Jason White and
Fitzgerald, who finished second by
128 points, put up phenomenal num-
bers on the season. But Oklahoma

one of those three.

Do’t forget!

went undefeated most of the year
and played for a pieceof the nation-
al championship, while Pitt got an
invite -to the Tire Bowl. T

Consider that, of the four final-
ists, Fitzgerald was the only one
from a team that ended the season
unranked and was not going to play
in a major bowl game. Strike one.

The fact that the Panthers lost
four games hurt Fitzgerald’s
chances. Strike two.

The teams that Pitt lost to hurt
Fitzgerald even more. Losing on the
road to Toledo and at home to Notre
Dame were games the Panthers
should have won, and the fact that
Fitzgerald had his worst game in
Pitt’s biggest contest ensured that
he wouldn’t win. Strike three.

- The loss to Miami, in which
Fitzgerald caught just three passes
for 26 yards, swung the voters
toward White. At the time,
Oklahoma was the best team in the
country and looked unbeatable. Of
the ballots that were turned after
that game, 40 percent of the points
went to White, while Fitzgerald
received a little more than 25 per-
cent. '

Why is the performance of the
team as a_ whole so" important?
Usually, if a team has a player who
is that‘ good, the team is just as
good. But sometimes that doesn’t
happen. One player can’t do it all,
especially in football. ’

Oklahoma had plenty of play-
makers, which is why. it had so
many players win individual awards
at their positions. Due to its lack of
a steady running game and a defense
that could tackle, Fitzgerald often
carried Pitt on his young back.

The fact that he had to do it all
should have added to Fitzgerald’s
chances of winning the Heisman,
not hurt him. But as long as the cri-
terion for the trophy is just “out-
standing player,” it will be almost
impossible for a great player from a
mediocre team 8 to get the, little
bronze guy. a

Panthers unable to capitalize on opportunities

Bowl, page 1

After quickly driving the ball
down the field in its opening pos-
session of the game, Pitt was
stuffed on four consecutive plays
after setting up a first and goal from
the 3. Virginia got the ball back on
a turnover on downs and made a
drive of its own, finishing with a
52-yard touchdown pass to Heath
Miller to take a 7-0 lead.

The Panthers struck back imme-
diately, marching 73 yards on the
ensuing drive to tie the game. Wide
receiver Princell Brockenbrough

scored on a 13-yard pass from quar-
terback Rod Rutherford.

Virginia quickly regained its
lead on a 1-yard touchdown run by
Wali Lundy to go ahead 14-7, but
the Panthers refused to go away.

Brandon Miree got Pitt within a‘

point after grabbing a screen pass
and racing in for a 17-yard touch-
down. The passfinished off an
impressive 85-yard scoring drive,
but after David Abdul missed the
extra point, the Panthers still
trailed, 14-13. The miss later
‘proved to be crucial.

“You can’t miss an extra point,”

Harris said. “You just can’t.”

As time ran out in the first half,
the Cavaliers got three more points
after a successful 44-yard field goal
attempt by Connor Hughes, taking a
17-13 halftime lead into the locker
room.

The second half scoring opened
up quickly after another successful
field goal by Hughes, this time from
30-yards out. Pitt responded with a
field goal of its own, however, after
a 28-yard kick from a different
kicker, walk-on J .B. Gibboney.

the fourth quarter to go ahead 23-
16, still leaving the Panthers within
a touchdown.

After an inspiring 44-yard kick-
off return by William Furgeson, Pitt

looked to be in business to tie and .

take the game into overtime.

But the Cavalier defense, which
was brilliant all day, sacked
Rutherford again, forcing a fumble
and recovering it to "close out the
game.

Virginia’s defense proved to be
well prepared for the much-touted
Pitt offense. Pitt wide receiver
Larry Fitzgerald was held to only

"five catches for 77 yards, with no

touchdowns, ending his [streak of
consecutive games with a touch-
down reception at 18.

“Virginia played V hard,”.

_ Rutherford said of his final game as
?fUa Panther. “I don’t think we had a
bad day. I just think they came out
. ready and they got the job done.”

Fitzgerald quiet about next step;

Heisman, page 20

Fitzgerald responded by saying,
“Voters are going to vote for who
they want_ to vote [for], and that’s
their liberty.”

Those questions brought up dealt
with the fact that 44 percent» of the
votes came in week three of voting,
which was after Pitt lost to Miami,

but before Oklahoma lost to Kansas .

State in the Big 12 Championship.

Fitzgerald received the most points

of all the candidates in the final
week of voting, which was the week
following Oklahoma’s loss.

‘ Steering clear of all the media’s

questions about who is really the

most outstanding player in college
football, Fitzgerald said it was just
an honor to be in New York.

Also, when asked what he felt he
has done for Pitt, he responded with,
“I don’t look at it that way. I look at
it more of what Pitt has done for me.
[Pitt -has] elevated me as a player and

a person. I’ve been around tremen-

dous people at this University.” .

As for the question of Fitzgerald
being around for a run at the 70th
Heisman, Trophy, he still does not
know, saying he is not certain what
the future holds for him, but one
could assume he is good for a touch-
down or two, whether it be at college
or in the pros.
