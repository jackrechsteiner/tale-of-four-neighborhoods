VOLUME IVC NUMBER 35

  A callfor peace

GREG HELLER-LABELLE
Staff Writer

Students at Pitt joined with those from

Carnegie Mellon University, Chatham -

College and Duquesne University Friday
afternoon for a peace rally opposing
Operation: Inﬁnite Justice and military
action inAfghanistan.

The protest, organized in part by
Students in Solidarity’s Anti-War
Committee, battled counter—protesting and
disruptions while attracting hundreds of fol-

_ lowers from around the city.

The peace rally, heralded on campus by
chalk .“got peace?” advertisements, was
organized ofﬁcially only two days before by
an intercampus ad hoc coalition.

“We decided to . do this ﬁrmly on
Wednesday,” said Mark Egerman, a sopho-
more at CMU. “We’ve been working pretty
much nonstop.”

Sophomore Josh Weinberg, a member
of Students in Solidarity, was one of the
main organizers of the protest.

“War begets war, violence begets vio-
lence,” Weinberg said. “We have an oppor-
tunity to stop it before it gets really terrible.
It’s not really a popular View right now, but
it needs to be sai .”

The protest began on the Cathedral
lawn in front of Heinz Chapel, where prob-
lems began by han ' g of the large peace
symbol banner that Students in Solidarity
made for the occasion. The ban_ner,.-‘which
had already been rained on the day before
during its creation, was supposed to hang
ﬁom the Cathedral’s east wall, a violation of
Pitt policy.

Students from area universities gather on the Cathedral lawn for a protest

against military action. ~

The protest hit another snag when a
question arose .as to whether the protesters
had the lawn reserved. Pitt‘ police chief Tim
Delaney said he received “no notiﬁcation”
of the reservation, which had been made
that moming.

After resolving the matter with the Pitt
police, the protest planners’ spread the ban-
ner out on the Cathedral lawn as the students
from CMU arrived with signs proclaiming
“Deploy food, not troops” and “War isn’t
‘kicking ass’, it’s killing people.”

' Egennan began the protest with a refer-
ence to the banner problems.

“We have it on the grounds, they
wouldn’t let us put it on the building, but

we’re still here and we’re gonna ﬁght,” he
said through a bullhom.

The protesters carried the barmer as
they circled the Cathedral, stopping at the

south, west and north patios to chant and

sing.
Trailing the protesters was counter-pro-

“I’m just an average Joe. Eighty bucks
and anyone can get one at Radio Shack,” he
said, gesturing to his own bullhom.

Beanie babies, Avdn products, hand-
made goods from Ecuador, vintage comic
books, trading cards, baked treats and a
host of old purses, books and dirmerware
were all on display behind Hillman
Library Saturday.

This motley mix of merchandise was
assembled to raise money for Pitt’s Staff
Association Council’s Book Fund for
Children of Staff Scholarship. Proceeds
from this ﬁrst armual ﬂea market will go

toward buying books for Pitt staff mem-
bers’ children.

Tables were sold to vendors at a cost
of $20 for one table, $30 for two tables and
$5 for each additional table after that. Only
the money made from selling tables went
to the scholarship ﬁmd — vendors kept
whatever money they made. ‘

‘This is a good venue,” said Joan
King, who has a pottery. studio in
Lawrenceville, Pa. “I like these craft fairs,
and you get feedback on what you make.”

While most of the tables held long-
forgotten items from staff members’ attics,

some items, like King’s pottery, were
made_ to be sold at the event. Denora
Craighead, who works in the Learning
Skills Center, devoted her table to Avon
products. * .

“I didn’t expect to do a lot of business

because when you think of a ﬂea market,

you don’t think of Avon,” she said. “[But]-

I’ve gotten some future customers out of it
so it was worth my while.” —
Andy Schreck, who works for th

College of Arts and Sciences, displayed his
collection of trading cards and comic
books.

Scholarship

“This is all stuff I’ve obsessively been
into over the past 30 years,” he said.

While the ﬂea market was vast in its
diversity, the amount of people showing
up wasn’t. Tables lined the patio behind
Hillman Library, but only a handful of
them were in use.

“We didn’t know how many to
expect,” said Babs Mowery, president of
the Staff Association Council. Mowery
pointed ‘out that although the council
advertisedithe sale, there were no signs

Mayor Murphy celebrates nig of

. LAUREN UNGER
The Pitt News

As a cool breeze blew ﬂoating

bunches of red, white and blue bal-

loons around in circles, dozens of

people gathered along the trail.

On vehicles ranging from unicy-
cles and tricycles with iridescent
streamers to horses and inline
skates, bikers, skaters and walkers
appeared Saturday morning to cele-

brate theiopening of two new river-

side trails and a bicycle rental facil-

. Mayor Tom Murphy was includ-

ed in the parade of riders, carrying
his own bike and donning a helmet
decorated with American ﬂags.

“It’s about changing Pittsburgh,”

Murphy said in his speech. “This is
about making the city an exciting
place.” Murphy ended his speech by
urging the gatherers to enjoy_the
trails and to keep pushing for their
further support and development.

The event continued with a rib-

bon cutting and a ride on the new

trails led by a bicycling Murphy
accompanied by skating and biking
groups, citizens and the mounted

police.

The trails, located in the South
Side, are the city’s most recent step

THE PITT NEWS

toward building a network of recre-
ational opportunities and encourag-
ing new modes of transportation.
David M. Feehan, a former resident
of Pittsburgh and the president of
the International Downtown
Association, called the trails, “a dif-
ferent view on Pittsburgh.”

“You could not imagine some-
thing like that [in Pittsburgh] in the
‘60s or ‘70s,” Feehan said.

With the addition of these seg-
ments there are now two miles of
continuous trails running through
the South Side.

The trails provide a paved sur-
face, smooth enough for inline
skates and bicycles, surrounded by
landscaped areas. Riding on the
opening lap of the trail, Dan Earley,
a member of the Pittsburgh chapter
of the National Skate Patrol, said he
enjoyed the new trail.

“There’s a real feeling of free-
dom out there,” Barley said.

_ The morning also saw the open-
ing of Golden Triangle Bike Rentals,
located Downtown near First
Avenue. The facility offers bicycle
rentals with free helmets and maps,
as well as snacks and guided tours.

In the future, the rental facility

Student volunteers
work to save animals

SUSANNE FORLANO
The Pitt News

A small calico kitten reaches her paw
out in a beckoning motion as freshman
Rebecca Wolfenden gently places her back
into the dreary steelcage at the Animal
Rescue league.

Student Volunteer Outreach gave Pitt
students another opportunity to volunteer
Saturday, sending about 10 students to the
animal shelter. _

By 2005 Animal Rescue League wants

to become a r1o-kill shelter. Instead of putting ,

down an animal that is not adopted, a no-kill
shelter holds on to it indeﬁnitely. Pam
Hawley, volunteer recruiter for the organiza-
tion, said that in order to accomplish that, the
league needs more volunteers.

“By having a group come in we can
give a lot more dogs and cats exercise than
we could through only a couple of volun-
teers,” Hawley said. _

After a brief orientation and tour, stu-
dents are ready to walk the 70 rambunctious
dogs and puppies and cuddle with the 108

cats and kittens. _

In the kennel a few cages held blue
signs reading, “Dear Volunteer, Please walk
me today. I haven’t been outside in a while.
Thank you so muc .”

As soon as volunteers attach their leash
to a collar, the dogs lead the way outside.
Most students walk the dogs in Mellon Park,
the closest area with open grass.

Hawley said through SVO Pitt students »

get a feel for the place and many often return
on their own to volunteer.

The sound of barking disappears in the
narrow room where the cats are kept. Most
of the older cats curl up at the back of the
cage, while the kittens sit eagerly at the front.

Freshman Ashley Janiga said, “I love
cats and I’m not allowed to have any, so this
place is really nice to spend time with ani-
mals ” ‘

Hawley said she is grateful for the Pitt
students ” help.

“The more _an animal is cared for, the
more affectionate they become and the more
appealing they look to potential adopters,”
she said ‘ . '

Caribbean and Latin American
Festival introduces many cultures

CONSTANTINE POLITES
The Pitt News

Latin American and Caribbean culture
infused Pitt’s campus this weekend as
members of Pittsburgh’s community and
Pitt students united to celebrate cultural
diversity.

The 22nd Latin American and
Caribbean Festival took place in the
Wﬂliarn Pitt Union on Saturday from 1
p.m. until midnight.

“There are more people here than there.‘

were last year,” said Ligia Diaz—Roman,

' academic affairs and outreach assistant for

the Center for Latin American Studies and
the coordinator of this year’s festival.

According to CLAS’ Outreach coordi-
nator Rosalind Eannarino, the purpose of
the festival is to instruct the Pittsburgh com-
munity on the diversity of Latin American
and Caribbean cultures by exposing the dif-
ferent features of Latin America. The festi-
val featured a variety of countries’ food,
arts and crafts, music and dances.

‘The festival is a way of tying and
informing the student body of Pittsburgh
with cultural studies,” Eamiarino said.

This year’s new attractions were the

children’s activities. From face painting to _

storytime, children moved from station to
station learning and experiencing Latin
American culture. In addition, community

members provided the public with food,

from Cuba, Jamaica, Peru and Puerto 

p and handcrafts from Bolivia.

Entertaimnent included a live steel
drum band and several traditional dances
from countries in Latin America. The
Brazil Nuts Portuguese Club brought the
crowd to its feet as members of the club
dressed in ethnic Brazilian costumes per-
formed a Brazilian martial arts dance
known as “capoeira.”

According to Melissa Kelly, the vice
president of the Brazil Nuts Portuguese
Club, the club strives to educate the gener-

_ al public about various aspects of Brazilian

culture. , _

For the 22nd consecutive year, Miguel
Sague and the Guaracha took part by play-
ing from 9 p.m. until midnight. Many
danced away as the Guaracha performed
music from the Caribbean and Latin
America, including the samba and
merengue. _ 3

The Latin American and Caribbean
festival is only one of the many projects
CLAS does to promote cultural awareness
and diversity in the Pittsburgh area.

After months of organizing this year’s
festival, Diaz-Roman was pleased with the
outcome of the event.

As Spanish Club "president Adrienne
Heim said, “The festival is great because
there are lots of Latin American cultures
and ethnicities where Pitt students can
interact to learn.”

In addition to the proposed ben-
efits to the city as a whole, Alan D.
Hertzberg, a city councilman and
Pitt law school alumnus. who played
an active role in advocating the
trails, spoke about the benefits to
University students. ,
' Hertzberg said he sees the trails
as a recreational opportunity that is
especially important to students in

an urban campus and as a way to add .

to the overall attractiveness of the
University. Connecting directly with

the Oakland campus, Hertzberg said ’

the trails allow Pitt students to avoid
riding or skating on the traffic-filled
streets and bring about a new break
option for students bogged down by
studying or coursework.

Katz School unveils
new technology center

MIKE MASLANIK
The Pitt News

The Katz Graduate School of Business
ofﬁcially unveiled its , new PNC Team
Technology Center in Mervis Hall on Friday
at a ceremony attended by more than 200
Katz Graduate School of Business faculty
members, graduates and PNC Bank repre-
sentatives.

PNC donated $1.3 million to ﬁmd the
center, the largest contribution the corpora-
tion ever made. An additional $800,000
given by Charles M. Steiner went toward the
atrium of the newly renovated building.

The festivities took place on the ﬁrst
ﬂoor of/Mervis Hall, the home of the busi-
ness school. The opening marked the ﬁrst
major renovation to the 18-year-old hall. The
event began with speeches by Chancellor
Mark N ordenberg and PNC Bank chainnan,
president and CEO James Rohr. Katz
School Dean Frederick W. Winter also
spoke. - _
“[This facility] will dramatically
improve one of the region’s most important
schools,” Nordenberg said. 1

Following their comments, Nordenberg
and Rohr cut the ribbon and opened the cen-
ter. Guests were then invited to tour the new

facilities.

Improvements to the building include
18 new conference rooms where the
school’s 137 students can work in small
groups. Each room contains large tables,
plush oﬂice chairs and dry erase boards. The
rooms are also equipped with electrical out-
lets and Internet ports. _

Near the conference rooms is a lounge
with vending machines, a soda fountain, a
coffee machine, a microwave and a refriger-
ator. A small copy center is located near the
lounge. The new library is furnished with six
computers, two copiers and a printer, along
with an ‘extensive collection of reference
books and business journals. The new class-
rooms are auditorium style, with computer
ports built‘ into the desks.

The aim of the renovation was to pro-
vide students with the resources to learn in a
setting that is like the real business world.
PNC Bank’s partnership also gives students
an opportunity to learn from one of the
nation’s largest diversiﬁed ﬁnancial organi-
zations.

The gift of $1.3 million continues the
tradition of cooperation between Katz and
PNC. PNC provides smaller ﬁnancial con-
tributions to the school as well as employing
about 200 Katz graduates.

  Staff yard sale to benefit students

To apply for the scholarship, students
must have a parent on staif at Pitt and be
an undergraduate in good ‘academic stand-
ing. Only Pitt students are eligible.

The Staﬁ Association Council plans
to hold the ﬂea market in August next year,
so newly arrived students can purchase
items for their apartments or dorms. The
council also plans to advertise more exten-
sively, in the hopes of drawingmore stu-

. dents. _ A

are open to the University community.

Manprotests peace protest

as well as chanting “No justice, no peace,”
Childs followed for the duration of the rally,

‘causing the protesters to increase their

efforts with chants of “Peace yes, bombs no,

r Bush’s warhas gotto go” and “Hey, Dubya,
' swallow your pride, we don’t want your
‘ genocide.” I A, ‘ T '

Police had to separate.Ch_ilds from a
protester who shoved him repeatedly as
they marched.  . '

“Don’t try to intimidate me, you ass-
hole,” Childs said, and then sang “We shall
kill bin Laden” to the tune of “We Shall
Overcome.” ' \

Once back on the east lawn, soplio- ‘
more Andrew Horbal led the protesters in:

chanting. _ «

“We are in the right,” Horbal said. “We
are for peace. We know that we are patriot-
ic because patriotism is loving your country
and the people in your country who have to
go to war.” » ’

The protest joined hands around the
lawn in a moment of silence before crowd-
ing around the banner in the center of the
lawn.

Childs then began singing “All we are »

saying is give war a chance,” prompting a
group of protesters to respond with a chant

‘of “Shut the f--- up” before one protester ran

to Childs and placed his head in Childs’
bullhom.

After the police separated the protest-
ers, a bullhom duel ensued between Childs
and the protesters, who broke into a chorus
of Starr’s “War? What Is It Good
For?”

The protest circled the Cathedral once

- more, chanting the word “peace” and end-
ing on the Bigelow'Boulevard side of the
Cathedral, where Horbal, Weinberg and
other leaders addressed the crowd one last

“We will be back,” Horbal said. “We’re

not going anywhere. It’s only the beginning.

‘ They will hear us.”

The protest then broke down into
/smaller groups as Students in Solidarity col-

\lected names. Childs continued heckling the

. rally at close -distance until Pitt police
moved him to the other side of the west
lawm, V

 of the rally were pleased with
. the results. ' ’ l
“I  it went really well,” Weinberg
said. “Our message was heard. I was a little
disappointed‘that we didn’t get tohang our
barmer up, but‘\[_ﬂﬁnk the way we used it
was really creative.” .
“I didn’t l<nov‘v,_What to expect,” said
Egerman, who was out of breath after the
- protest. “It was a phenomenal success.”

Give dialogue a chance

Should we give peace a chance or
give war a chance?

Over the last three weeks, almost
all of us have tried to form an answer
to this question. Last Friday, hundreds
of people staged a protest on the
Cathedral lawn to give their answer as
peace.

Except for one man who followed
the protesters and said, “Give war a
chance,” the rally faced no major
objections.

During a time in which going to
war as retaliation for the Sept. 11
attacks is the prevailing sentiment,
those expressing differing viewpoints
can face much resistance.

This could not_be further from
what should happen at this time.
Whether or not you agreed with the
protesters on Friday, their expression
of their viewpoint in a peaceful,
respectful manner is a positive devel-
opment. While they faced only one
man who vocalized his opposition to
their cause, they could have faced
many more.

One of the protest’s organizers,
sophomore Andrew Horbal, said they
plan to rally again. It is our hope that
no one will attempt to stifle any
protests then.

Many who saw the rally might
have disagreed with the protesters. But

the rally made people think about the

issues at hand.

Not since the Vietnam War has the
United‘ States seen the potential for a
wave- of protests at college campuses
throughout the country. Our genera-
tion, often called apathetic, finds itself
facing the possibility of war and the
decision to support it.

Those in favor of war say that our
soldiers are going overseas to defend
our basic liberties, including free
speech. .

As such, no one should stiﬂe that
freedom of speech. Whether the
United States goes to war or not will
affect our lives, and since we live in a
democracy, we have the right — and
the duty — to contribute to these deci-
sions. ‘

Active, informed dialogue will
undoubtedly inﬂuence how our coun-
try responds to this crisis. Discussion
between people with opposing views
will allow people — including top-level
decision-makers — to consider differ-
ent information and come to a reason-
able conclusion on what we should do.

So whether you’re a hawk or a
dove, don’t hesitate to support your
viewpoint. Promote dialogue. Inform
others. Be informed by others. Don’t

be afraid to stand up for your beliefs,‘

but don’.t try to impose them on others.
Listen to people with differing per-
spectives -— you may learn something.

success is very simple.

Back at Grace, my daily walk to

because of the terrain or campus

Those freakin’ Hoosiers just loved
to hear about my day.

line with a “Hi.” Finally, they
would pop the inevitable “How are
you doing?” and reel me in. I would

Here at Pitt, no one cares how
my day is going. Though I have to
cover a fair distance of crowded
streets to get to every class, no one
seems to consider the prospect of
throwing a smile my way. It makes
travel so efficient. I can leave my
apartment 10 minutes before any
class and head out into the world
without the fear that I might have to

wonder, ‘.‘Have the words on this

“Does this pen still have ink in it?”
or “What’s the copyrightdate on
this book?” Any object will do, as
long as it gives you a reason to
divert your eyesaway from the

looking straight ahead. Focusing

God doesn’t operate on our schedules

When the phone rang at two in

the morning, I wasn’t exactly in the

mood to listen.
Realizing that it was my
boyfriend’s drunken roommate call-

guess cows aren’t all that inspira-
tional.

I went into each activity full of
enthusiasm. I wanted to find a mes-

ingto “check up” didn’t
help the situation. Tired
and nursing a cold, I ded-
icated my Friday night to
recuperation. A late night
wake up call was not
what I needed.

Being a faithful girl-
friend, I fought the urge
to hang up while I waited
for Omer, my boyfriend,
to get on the line. Don’t

summon it myself. With
every unsuccessful hour
that passed I looked
ahead, wondering when
“the time”. would come. I
was confident that it
would come and I’d be
ready.

Ready all the way
through Sunday after-
noon, when I‘climbed

happy to hear from him. Living six
hours apart has made me appreciate
our late night chats more than ever.

Just not at the cost of my sleep.

My mood lightened as we
talked. Mostly Omer talked and I
listened, as I was still having trou-
ble forming complete sentences.
But I realized how awesome it was
just to hear his voice and feel like
he was near. By the time we hung
up I was content and- collapsed back
into bed with a smile on my face.

I don’t usually expect late night
calls. But as much as I like to plan
everything, I find I’m happiest
when the unexpected comes along.

Not that I have learned to apply
this lesson in the rest of my life.

When I had the chance to go on
a church retreat last weekend, I
seized the opportunity. Sept. l1’s
attacks shook up my world and I
was seriously feelingethe need to
“check in” on my relationship with
God. So I put off my aversion to
camping and headed for cow coun-
try in search of inspiration.

Judging -from my experience, I

trip home.

On the ride I tried to sort out
what had happened. Easy enough —
absolutely nothing. The weekend
was all right, but nothing more. I
met some cool people, had a little
fun around the campfire and
enjoyed the beautiful countryside
—— a particular thrill after a solid
month within the city limits. It was
a normal, fairly. pleasant weekend.
But not the meaningful journey I
planned.

As I pondered my lack of spiri-
tual guidance, disappointment gave
way to frustration. I had done
everything I was supposed to. I
gave up my weekend for God. I did
my best to get into all the ‘prayers
and Bible studies. I even listened to
other kids’ life stories for inspira-

tion. I opened myself, ready to lis-_

ten and I heard nothing. I felt disap-
pointed.
Within a few ‘hours, though, my

perspective began to change. The .

more I thought about what went

wrong, the more I realized that I,

had really missed the mark. If any-
one had skipped out on a commit-

ment, I had.

In any relationship you have to
be there. Whether keeping up with
daily prayers or being there to calm
a boyfriend’s worries, you can’t just
tune in when you feel like it. It’s
great to listen when you have the

time, but it’s listening when you’

don’t want to that matters.

As a compulsive list-maker and
amicable power freak, I hate not
being in control. But the frighten-
ing, amazing thing about putting’
your trust in someone -— or some-
thing —- else is that you gain ‘a lot
by giving up a little. -

Since I hadn’t been willing to
listen when I had parties to go to or
homework to do, how could I
expect God to come at my conve-
nience? ,

It would be great to order a reli-

gious experience as easily as a .

Whopper at Burger King. But the
experience would probably be just
as significant. If Mother Nature and
the muses refuse to operate under
human jurisdiction, God probably
won’t either. i
I still haven’t had that ‘great
epiphany I was looking for. Then
again, the times I’ve really “felt
God” have never been at times of
my choosing. But they’ve always
come when I needed them, just like
sleepy phone calls from the people I
love. ‘

Surrounded by peaceful woods, a tran-
quil stream and a picturesque waterfall,
Fallingwater provides a natural escape from
the city’s steel and glass skyscrapers and
urban commotion.

Little more than an hour southeast of
Pittsburgh, architect Frank Lloyd Wright’s
famous building lies amid thousands of acres
of protected forest. Designed in 1935 for
Pittsburgh’s Kauﬁnann family, it was even-
tually given to the Western Pemrsylvania
Conservancy in 1963. Fallingwater has the
unique distinction as the only Wright build-

  Falling for nature

possesses a similar aura inside. Wright coat-

further this theme, the living room has a set

through the ﬂoor. The Kaufmanns were very
fond of the creek, and this addition allowed

them to spend time there without leaving the 

privacy of their home. A
Some of the most amazing aspects of
the house include the decks built over the

creek. The decks appear to defy gravity as H

they hang over the water without any visible
supports. Wright used a cantilever system,
similar to the design of a diving board, to
accomplish this feat. Equally as amazing as

Spanning the length of ﬂre walls, win-

Warhol hosts lynching exhibit

Without Sanctuary: Lynching
Photography in America

MELISSA MEINZER
The Pitt News

The elevatorride to the sixth ﬂoor of the Andy
Warhol Museum was full of nervous people
unsure of what to expect. Everyone knew the

images at this exhibit would be disturbing and

potent, yet they were drawn to them.

In the American South from the 1870s to the
1950s-, lynching was a stark fact of life. It was so
accepted that photographs of lynched bodies were
made into postcards and kept as mementos. pi

JamesAllen, an antiques dealer from Atlanta,
collected more than 100 of these images and orga-
nized them into an exhibit called “Without
Sanctuary,” on display at the Warhol until Dec.
31.

Sometimes jubilant and smiling,
lynch mobs surround the mutilated
corpses in the photographs. The mobs
consisted mostly of white men but
included some women and even boys and girls as
young as 12.

One postcard of a burnt corpse bears the mes-
sage, “This is the barbecue we had_ last night. Your
son, Joe.” _

Lynching was not limited to the South, or even
the distant past. One of the photos came from East

Stroudsburg, Pa. The latest one, from McDuffie

County, Ga., dates back to 1960. _
In an adjacent room, images drawn from cur-

rent media put the photos in a contemporary con-

text. Clippings from newspapers and magazines

relay a still-imperfect sense of race relations in
America. A work in progress consists of articles’ _

pertaining to racism after the attacks of Sept. 11.
The’ Warhol devoted an entire wall to clip-
pings from the Pittsburgh Courier, the black news-
paper that championed the anti-
lynching cause. , -
Blank books sit at a table and visi-
tors are encouraged to write their

‘ thoughts and feelings on the exhibit.
One visitor wrote a single, unsigned phrase in
the middle of the page: “Divided, we fall.’’ A child
drew a picture of a black man hanging in a tree

NATALIE KRASMAN & MATT WEIN
' The Pitt News

In their 2000 season, the Panthers
volleyball team crushed Big East rival
Seton Hall 3-0, and hope to mirror its
past performance this year.

The Panthers did not shut out the
Pirates this year, but were able to
squeeze out a 3-2 win in a tiebreaker on
Saturday at Fitzgerald Field House.

With a near loss, head coach Chris

A Beerinan emphasized the most impor-

tant team goal for the remainder of the
season — to play better.
“We are coming out tense and

A afraid and our game is not relaxed. The

polls rated us No. 2 in conference
matchups, and sometimes I think the
team worries about that too much. The
best plan is just to relax and play,’’
Beerman said. ’

With 253 sets of eyes on hand, the

tense Panthers opened up the night with

a 30-22 loss.

The Panthers took a time out early _

on in the first match when the Pirates
scored seven straight points to take the

1 lead 12-6. The women never main-

tained a lead and threatened to bring
the score within ﬁve only once in the
first match. They "also demonstrated
their weakest attack in the first match,

killing only nine shots.

Beerman believes the women will _ '

only improve if they play with more
consistency. '
“We are inconsistent too often, and

our defensive intensity should be in 2

every play, and it is not,” Beerinan
said.

The women improved their ‘offen-
sive and defensive performance in the

second match, defeating the Pirates 30- if

28. .
The match started out with the

Panthers and Pirates exchanging the

lead. With a 6-5 lead, Seton Hall hit a

hot streak and scored -six consecutive

points.

. After a Panthers timeout, 6-foot-1-
inch junior Dionna Hayden stopped the
rallying Pirates with a termination to
make the score 12-6. With a little back
and forth play, the score reached 17-10
when Wendy Hatlestad‘ shot a hard put
away into the faces of the Pirates
defense.

Melissa Whaley, Lindsay Macke
and Carrie Norris all served aces later
in the match, and Whaley put up the
final block for the Panthers to win in
match two.

At the end of the half a disturbing
chant blared from the bleachers of the
Fitzgerald Field House.

After that it was all Hurricanes, and

The Panthers came out strong and

held an early lead throughout the"

match. Seton Hall served with the
score 27-20. Heather Haff had a terrni-

. nation and Hatlestad later added a put

away to bring up match point. Haff
served and after a few bounced-around
shots, Hayden put away a win for the
Panthers.

The Panthers led 2-1 in matches,
and the women wanted to ship the
Pirates back to Seton Hall with a loss.

But despite the valiant efforts of
Abby F echhelm and Gini Ullery who
served up aces and Hayden and
Hatlestad who distributed terminations
the women were unable to pull out a
win in the fourth match and lost 30-27.

Tied at two ‘matches each, the
teams lined up for a decision-breaking
fifth match. .

Junior setter Norris put the
Panthers out in front early with a 2-0
lead, but the Pirates did not sit back
quietly and managed to keep the score
within two the entire match.

Fechhelm faced match point serve

serve, chants for Seton Hall increased,
but Ullrey ignored the Pirates fans and
smacked down a strong game-winning
termination, sending the Panthers to a
5-5 record and 2-0 in the Big East. ,
The Panthers’ fans’ support was
out-voiced through the entire game,
and Beennan commented on the lack

-of enthusiasm in respect to the team’s
performance. . -

“I’m impressed with the turnout
from Seton Hall._ I didn’t think our
team was distracted by their chanting,
but I think it would beneﬁt the team if

we received more support from Pitt‘

Players such as Hatlestad, Hayden,

I back into my psyche.

Twenty-one days.

This was the wait that.I had to endure
before watching my beloved Pittsburgh
Steelers take the ﬁeld for the second time

this season. Granted, for the majority of .

those 21 days, football was

prospects for the 2001 season.

The Steelers are just ﬂat-out bad this
year. _. »
You might question the timing of this
column when you look at

the furthest thing from my
mind as was the case with
fans, players and coaches"
throughout the country.

But as last week rolled
along and the weekend came
around, that old anticipation
of a brisk fall Sunday with
piles of laundry, a bag of chips
and a 19-inch television pro-

viding the soundtrack, crept

the score of yesterday’s
game, but anyone who
actually watched the game
may not be so quick" to
judge. Despite excellent
ﬁeld position throughout
the game, the Steelers
offense failed to mount an
impressive drive against a
Buffalo defense that gave
up 534 total yards the previ-
ous week against the
Indianapolis Colts.

I began to wonder if the Steelers
were really as anemic as they appeared to
be in a Sept. 9 21-3 thrashing at the hands

it of the Jacksonville Jaguars. “Surely, you

can’t properly judge a team based on
only one performance, no matter how
pathetic,’.’ I convinced myself. “And
who’s to say that a team can’t make some
huge adjustments during a 21-day lay-
oﬁ?”

As I watched the Steelers defeat the
Buffalo Bills 20-3 on the road on Sunday,
I came to a fairly obvious yet painful

Their ﬁrst offensive
touchdown of the season did not come
until late in the fourth quarter when they
were simply milking clock time, and
good ol’ Kordell Stewart was ﬂoating
balls and hanging his receivers out to dry

‘ all day.

But the Steelers’ biggest -problems
came not on the oﬁensive side of the ball,
but in mental breakdowns. The Steelers
were penalized 12 times for 125 yards
and a team with as little talent as the
Steelers can ill afford to be undisciplined.

There were bright spots for the

‘Steelers on Sunday. They failed to turn

the ball over, and their defense was phe-
nomenal, particularly against the run. But
an ultra-conservative offense and an
aggressive defense can only take a team
so far. - '

The Steelers were playing against a
Bills team that is now 0-3 and has a
league-high 19 rookies on their roster.
But the monstrous defenses of the AFC
Central (Baltimore, Tennessee, and
Jacksonville) loom on the Steelers sched-
ule, not to mention a nonconference
game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

Those teams will force the Steelers to
turn the ball over, and eventually it will
come down to Pittsburgh to either put
points on the board or get annihilated.

Understand that I am not always

1 doom and gloom when it comes to the

black and gold. I have both personally
and publicly (to my discredit) been a big
supporter of the idea that the Steelers
would bounce back over the last three
years. But my blind resilience is ﬂoun-
dering, and I refuse to prolong my pain as
I have for so many seasons. The Steelers
will be lucky to win six games this year,

and will fail to make the playoffs for the

fourth straight season if they continue to

play at their current level. - .
How can the Steelers break out 0

league Kenneth Paul wrote a column
calling for Rod Rutherford to start at
quarterback for the Pitt Panthers, coining
the phrase “In Rod we Trust.” Who am I
to argue with KP? Why don’t we take
that concept and apply it to the pro level
in the ‘Burgh as well?

Tee Martin is looking like a really
good alternative right now, and don’t be
surprised to see him getting some more
reps in practice and causing a stir as “the
ﬁlture ‘quarterback of the Steelers.”
Kordell needs to stop worrying about not
beating himself and start creating and
sending a message, and while I like the
simpliﬁed playbook oﬁensive coordina-
tor Mike Mularkey installed, it apparent-
ly hasn’t made Stewart’s accuracy any
better. Could it be “Tee Time” in
Pittsburgh?

OK, that’s lame, but the prospect of
Pittsburgh being awﬁil for yet another
year has scrambled my -brains and forced
me to resign myself to cheesy catch
phrases in order to stay entertained. I
don’t mean to spoil the party for Steelers

fans basking in the glory of yesterday’s '

win, but victory does not equal quality,
and there was very little quality displayed
by either team in Buffalo yesterday.

West Virginia (2-2, 1-0) suffered a
loss at College Park at the hands of the

The Mountaineers fell behind early
7-0 and eventually tied the score at 13 in
the second quarter. After that Maryland
took control with Mike Whaley’s 52-yard
touchdown run on a fumble recovery.

Maryland scored again in the third
quarter, but West Virginia answered right

Shawn Terry, which put_ the
Mountaineers within ﬁve, but Maryland
put another touchdown on the board with
2 minutes, 49 seconds left in the fourth
quarter to seal the victory.

winning 20-3 at one point but let the
Pirates slip back into the game.

The Orangemen sealed their. 44-30
victory when East Carolina took a 30-29
lead early in the fourth quarter. East
Carolina gambled on an onside kick and
lost, and Syracuse took over on East
Carolina’s 46-yard line. This eventually
set up running back James Mungro’s 6-
yard touchdown run.

Mungro finished the day with 76
yards on 22 carries and a touchdown.

Syracuse quarterback Troy Nunes

Starting spots available follog loss

Volleyball, page 16

28 kills and 17 digs.
Game leader Hatlestad was happy with the over-
all performance of the team, but would like the team

I to keep pushing their efforts in order to keep compet-
1 itive and win games for the remainder of the season.

—— Natalie Krasman, The Pitt News

Ineffectiveness: this has been a reoccurring
theme at Fitzgerald Field House recently. This week-
end, a water main break left the building’s plumbing
system ineffective. ‘ ,

Sunday afternoon, the Pitt volleyball team lost to
the St. John’s Red Storm, turning in a performance
that can only be described as ineffective, despite
strong performances from Hatlestad and Norris.

“This is a team that put too much pressure on
. itself,” ‘said Beerman following the five-match loss.

St. John’s started off strong in the first match,
scoring nine points to Pitt’s three. The Panthers were
able to slightly regain composure and stay competi-
tive in the first match, but ultimately lost by a score
of 30-25.

In the second match, the Panthers retaliated. They
scored the first point and managed to hold the lead
throughout the entire game. They recorded 15 kills en
route to a 30-23 win.

After showing signs of life in the second match,
the Panthers looked to stay competitive emerging
from the locker room after the break. This did not
happen, as they dropped the third match‘ 30-20.

The fourth match saw the Panthers regain
strength. They started off on a seven to two run.

Later, with the score at eight to four in their favor,
they scored six unanswered points as a part of an 8-1
run, and took the match by a score of 30-21.
While_the game was even at two games apiece
heading into the fifth and deciding match, St. John’s

proved to be the stronger team, taking the match 15- i

11. Strong baseline play coupled with four unan-
swered points powered the Red Storm to their third
Big East win of the season.

Immediately following the game, Beerman met
with his team behind closed doors for a considerable
amount of time. Afterward, he expressed discontent
with his team’s performance.

“The bottom line is that we were not emotionally
ready to play. We never really comp'eted that hard,”
Beerman said. _ ‘

When asked what hethought his team’s main
weaknesses were, he said, “Everything. It all needs,
work.”

' Beerman also said that he will be opening up
starting positions for competition, rather than stick
with the starting lineup he used all seasonlong.

“We need to ﬁnd people to play for us. We have

to change the way that this team plays and try to take _ '

/some of the pressure off,” Beerman said.

One bright spot for the Panthers, as it has been all
season, was Hatlestad’s play, who recorded the dou-
ble-double with 28 kills and 18 digs. Hayden chipped
in with 17 digs while Ullery recorded 15, and Norris
added 49 assists. '

The loss drops the Panthers to a record of 5-6
overall‘ and 2-1 in the Big East. The team will return
to action Friday as the Panthers travel to Georgetown.
