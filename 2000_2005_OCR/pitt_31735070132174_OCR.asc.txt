of the program is when the volunteers ﬁrst
walk through the doors and the children run
up to their Jumpstart member and hug them.

But it can be hard leaving ﬂue children
after the school year is over or for winter
break, she said.

‘ “They - don’t really understand,”
Jackson said, describing how the girl she
worked with last year cried when she left.

“We live at school,” Jumpstart member
Brianne Renz. explained to her child at
Mount Washington while washing paint off
of his hands. Renz tried to explain to a sad-
looking Alex that d11ring Christmas, all the
college students go home to their parents.
She added that they’d be back in January.

And as Dan Irzyk packed his backpack
with the children’s books he had brought to
the daycare that day, his child cried out, “Not
goin’, not goin’.” ' -

“But I have to,” Irzyk said.

The children develop a close relation-
ship with their Jumpstart member, Renz
said, because they feel as though “someone
cares about them speciﬁcally”

She said she feels as though she devel-
ops a closer bond with her child during the
one-on-one reading time, “because they
never get the chance to have someone read
just to them.”

‘Trying to get ﬂie family involved is a

big challenge,” Renz ‘added, even though it,
is an important goal of the program.

Renz said she had not even met with the
mother of her child.

“She doesn’t seem too interested,” she
said.

At the daycare, Karen Ricco, the Mount
Washington team leader, ﬂicked the lights
on and oif three times.

“Clean up; clean up. Everybody, every-
where,” everyone around ﬂie table chimed in
a singsong voice as the Jumpstart members
and the children started picking up dolls and
puzzle pieces and putting away the paints.

But some children were a little harder to
persuade that it was time to settle down and
get ready to go home.

“No n1nning,” Holtz told the no—longer—
green—ﬁsted Johnny as she tried to get him to
put his shoes back on. Instead, Johnny
stopped in the middle of the carpeted ﬂoor
and started spinning around in circles with
his arms, bent at the elbow, sticking out from
his sides.

“Are you the Hulk?” Holtz asked.

“I’m the Tasmanian Devil!” he cried in
glee, smiling, but never skipping a beat, as
he continued to spin around in a circle. The
Spiderman-shirt-wearing Johrmy did not
seem to feel loyalty toward one superhero.

Several feet away, Irzyk was sharing a
more relaxed parting ﬁom his child, Nick, as
he squatted down to receive a goodbye hug.

The perpetrator was allegedly one of
several people traveling in an automobile.
The automobile stopped, and the people
inside said something to the victim, accord-

ing to Delaney. Uncertain what the peoplein

the car said said, the victim hesitated. The
perpetrators apparently thought he was
refusing to cooperate, so they shot him,
Delaney said. _, -

The perpetrator, without taking money
or oﬂier items from the victim, ﬂed the scene
in a‘ light-colored Sedan. The victim was
taken to the hospital for treatment.

' Possibly in connection With the incident
at Pitt’s Health Book Store, another robbery
occurred at Footer’s Dry Cleaners & Tailors
Inc. on Forbes Avenue, at about 3: 15 p.m. on
Jan. 28.

The perpetrator was described as a

“We’re always trying to ﬁnd anoﬂier tip or

lead that will put us where we need to be [in

catching criminals].”~

Pitt police are working  conjunction ’

with Zone 4 city police and the Oakland
Business Improvement District in hopes of
tracking down their suspects or ﬁnding other

“We try ‘to stay as heavy as we can with
our robbery tips,” Delaney said.

Students are advised to always travel
with a friend, use SafeRider (formerly Van
Call) whenit’s available, and not walk alone
or carry around a lot of cash. If confronted
by a robber, students should not try to resist,
and they should report the crime immediate-
ly.

“stick together [and] use Van Call, just to be

safe.” The SafeRider number is (412) 648-

Proposed budget slashes arts, not defense

Call me Ishmael, but not for much

President Bush unveiled his pro-
posed budget Monday —— a budget- that
boosts homeland security and defense
spending, but slashes spending on the
arts, equality education for women and
Olympic scholarships, to name a few,
according to Reuters. It also slashes fund-
ing for a program aimed at native
‘Alaskans and Hawaiians
“exchanges with historic whaling and
trading partners.” V

All of this means that children will
no longer be able to draw, feel empow-
ered, high. jump or learn about their
Moby Dick-ish history.

And why has Bush decided to can in _

the irony brigade? His budget slashes
flmding for alcohol education, recreation-
al programming and literacy. For a pro-
ponent of physical education who talks
about his own recovery from alcoholism
and whose wife is a librarian, his budget

directly contradicts his values.
Many of these programs fund non-
government projects — think: the

National Endowment for the Arts giving
money to writers — none of whom suffer
from an excess amount of frmding.

Bush cited the programs’ redundancy
and being out-of-date as reasons for cut-
ting them. If that is the case, then redun-
dancy should be deﬁned more carefully
before these -programs are eliminated.

Streamlining these or siphoning

called ‘

money from cut programs to better serve
remaining ones would be more effective

than the slash-ahd-bum budgeting on

which Bush seems so intent. -
Moreover, as reported in the Los
Angeles Times, this budget doesn’t pro-
vide any provisions for funding military
operations in Afghanistan and Iraq.
While the nation is busy beating its plow-
shares into swords — in the form of a 7
percent increase in defense spending —
we’ll have no money to take care of the
two ‘countries that we are occupying.

After defense, education is Bush’s"

next priority. But for a presidentwhose
ﬂagship program is called ‘No Child Left
Behind,” it seems that no child will be left
behind because no one will be? moving
forward. Even though Bush pfoposed a
rise in overall education funding, the fact
that he wanted to cut these programs is
counter-productive.

7 Rather than funding additional test-
ing, why not throw money towards liter-
acy programs?

One bright spot in this gloom of
spending cuts is Bush’s proposed
increase in funding for disadvantaged and
handicapped students, according to the
Dow Jones wire service. ‘ .

But what’s more disadvantaged than
having your cultural heritage taken away,
like the native Hawaiians? Making some
students more disadvantagedto improve
the lives of others leaves‘ everyone-
behind.

Living without wheat: no cookies for me

Among my many memories of summer

One of the counselors, whose actual name I

by the other counselors and campers. Why?
For being a “wheatard” While “I knew that

this oh-so-politically conectnickname was a

variation of the oft—used
moniker “lactard,” meaning
one who is lactose intoler-

Stop fussing over NippleGate: Bible, art have nudity without prurience

I met Olympia by surprise at the Musee
d’Orsay in Paris. I turned the corner, and
there she was, in all her glory, naked save a
black choker and a smirk She was young-
looking, 15 or 16 at the most,- but her one
concession to modesty was placing a hand
between her legs, ineﬁectively hiding her
pubic hair. I met Judith on the Internet. In her
picture, she was standing in a doorway, her
black hair ﬂowing, with her sheer dressing
gown open to the waist, exposing one
gleaming, rosynipple. I wasn’t yet 18 when
I went to Paris, and I certainly didn’t need to
verify my name or supply a credit card num-
ber to get on Judith’s Web site, yetl could see
these images.

ualized nudity and accidental exposure?

I was talking onAllVI to aﬁiend, who
mentioned something about NippleGate, to
which I responded, “Do these people take

‘ their children to art museums? They have

nipples _ up to their tympanums.” I don’t
mean to imply that people who can be scan-
dalized by a mere nipple have no apprecia-
tion for art. What I do mean to imply is that,
if they teach their children that nipples are
scandalous, then their kids will only associ-
ate nudity with sex, when it can be usedqin a
variety of other contexts. Nudity equals sex
only when there is intent involved. J ackson’s
nipple was ﬂashed during a song in which
Justin Trrnberlake vowed «to have all her
clothes off by the end of the song, which
contains far more connotations than a mere

body part. Perhaps someone should have
told John Ashcroft that before he covered up .

Lady Justice’s breast.'Her,breast was in no
way prurient, until he assigired intent to it. In
covering up the breast of a concept’s person-
iﬁcation, he showed that, when he looked at
her, he saw sex, and didn’t approve. News
ﬂash to Ashcroft; you can’t have sex with ‘a
concept, or with the statue of its personiﬁca-
tion. .‘

"And then thereis the “family entertain-
ment” billing that’s getting kicked around.
The ideaof letting men inrather tight pants
beat the crap of each other for a shiny trophy
seems to contradict the notion of wholesome
family fun. Moreover, people say they were
surprised by the nipple, and therefore could-
n’t prepare their children for its horrifying
impact. Yet both Judith and Olympia are
available on the Internet at artcom, which is
surely within the limits of parental control
software. Perhaps children should be taught
that no, sexualized gyratory dancing isn’t
appropriate, but pretty paintings made by
dead Frenchmen that changed art history are.

But if art’s not for sensitive, impression-
able children, try reading them the Bible.

Flipping through my favorite searehable “

Bible, www.bible.com, I ﬁnd that the word
“breast” is used 13 times in the Old and New
Testaments, and the word‘ “war” 111 times,
so already it seems to be espousing
American values. Oh, wait, what’s this:

,“'Ihy two breasts are like two young roes V
[deer] that are twins, which feed among the

lilies”? That, my friends, is Song of Solomon
4: 5. It’s one of the most beautiful love

_ _ poems everwritten, famous for its simple,
_ sensual descriptions of lovers romping,

which allegorically translates into a poem
about the pious’ relationship with God. It’s

‘ long, it’s dirty, and it’s available to anyone

with a copy of the Bible. Yes, that» means
young, impressionable children, as well as
old, Bible-loving perverts like myself.

The point is that, rather than shielding
children from every mention of a bared
breast, learn to teach kids the difference
between artistic nudity, symbolic nudity,
accidental nudity and plain; old porn. And
that will make all the difference.

Theron transforms into a “Monster”

Monster
Starring: Charlize Theron,
Christina Ricci

Directed: by Patty Jenkins
sfnfnik

A chilling and sometimes disturb-
ing movie, “Monster” turns the stom-
ach. Still, it is a captivating portrayal
of a haunting, true story.

Aileen Wuomos (Charlize Theron)
is a highway prostitute ready to take
her own life; she has lived a miserable
life of abuse as a child that ultimately
led to her hooking and more abuse.
“Monster” follows Aileen as she meets
a young woman named Selby
(Christina Ricci), and a relationship
forms between the two women.

Aileen talks Selby into staying
with her in Florida instead of going
back to live with her parents, who
shunned Selby for being a lesbian. In
order to make money for the two to
live together, Aileen hooks. But after
being raped and almost killed by one
man — whom she kills in self defense
—‘she takes on amentality that all
“Johns” are going to rape her. She con-
tinues to kill unsuspecting men, hiding
their bodies and taking their money.

Aileen Wuomos killed seven men

‘ and was eventually caught and execut-

ed in a Florida State Prison on Oct. 9,
2003.

Directed by Patty Jenkins, who
had previously directed only two short

films, “Just Drive” and “Velocity
Rules” in 2001, “Monster” is an
incredible story of a woman who was
very troubled.

Jenkins tells the story of Wuomos’
savage killings through the eyes of this
desperate woman, who had been a vic-
tim very early in life. Wuomos was
yearning for life — which she hadn’t
had much of — as well as love, which
she found in her new, young friend
Selby. Wuornos is shown losing all
hope in men; they only want her for a
quick job. No love is involved with the
men she‘has encountered.

Charlize Theron is phenomenal in
the role of Aileen Wuornos. She com-
pletely transformed her appearance for
this film, putting on 30 pounds for the
role while having her hair done in a
dirty mess. With makeup, she resem-
bles the real Wuornos to an almost
mirror image.

Theron not only had the look, but
she played a hurt and troubled

_Wuornos, angry atthe, world and

humankind. It’s hard to tell that it is
even Theron playing the role; it’s so
convincing, it’s scary.

Christina Ricci also did a wonder-
ful job as the young and confused les-
bian lover of Wuomos. Her character

was naive and impressionable, and

Ricci helped make it believable.
At one point, Ricci’s character was

terrified when she found out about the

Every now and then, a band

something that is fresh and differ-

band made up of three guys from
New 7 York, and their self-titled
album is all that, and more. A

The eclectic album includes

-songs such as the mostly a cappella

“Trunk of My Car” which features
the three guys of Volcano singing in

a round. The lyrics are simple, but
the harmonies are insanely interest-

sneaking into the song and a guitar,
the sound is shockingly unique.

Unlike the somewhat simple,

“Trunk of My Car,” “In Green” is a
fusion of several different sounds.
It is a mix between pop and rock,
with lead singer Mark Duplass’
voice giving the song a punk feel.
The. organ is prevalent in the song,
as it is in many of the tracks.

At first, you wonder if the organ

Off the wire:

Super Bowl

ads fumble this year  

LEAH BARKSDALE _ A
Oklahoma Daily (U. Oklahoma)

(U-WIRE) NORMAN, Okla. — The

2004 Super Bowl: one game and
one extremely expensive advertise-
ment.

But was it all really worth ‘it in
the end? A ’

“The Super Bowl is advertis-

' ing’s national holiday,” said Jim
Avery, advertising professor.
SuperBowl—’

According to
ads.com, the cost of a 30-second
commercial spot averaged approxi-
mately $2.25 million. .

“Buying a commercial during
the Super Bowl is not a sufficient
reach,” Avery said, “Advertisers
can reach just as many people by
buying one during the nightly news
throughout the week.” ‘

With every Super Bowl, people
wonder what the new commercials
willbe like: Will they be better than
last year? Which celebrities will
endorse each of the products?

Even though some commercials
featured original ideas like football

players singing about “Tomorrow”,

or senior citizens getting ugly over
a bag of potato chips, many agree

this year’s commercials lacked
something.

“This year’s commercials were
definitely subpar,” said Steven
Thomas,‘ elementary‘ education
junior, “But you know there’s only
so many funny ideas you can have
in 30 seconds.”

Despite some downfalls, ‘ many

, students agreed the commercial fea-

turing women playing snow volley-
ball was a great idea. “ H’ ' ’

“I really liked the volleyball-in-
the-snow one,” said Amanda La

,Fon, music education sophomore,

“I can’t wait for summer sports. A

lot [of thecommercials] I’ve seen

before, and they aren’t asfunny as
in the past.”~ ’

The most popular ads included a
donkey’s dream to ‘become a
Budweiser Clydesdale and a dog
that liked to fetch a little more than
just a beer for his owner, according

_ to a survey on Ifilm.com.

Just because the game is over
and the stadium is cleared doesn’t
mean you can’t watch .the,commer—
cials. Ifilm.com features a menu
where you can watch all your

-favorites and the commercials you

love to hate.

money and a car, she demanded that
Wuomos go back out into the night.
Ricci displayed control of her charac-
ter while going through emotional
changes.

Another important element in this
film was the soundtrack. Set in the
‘80s, the music played an important
role in supporting each scene. The

strongest point to this is in a scene
where Aileen and Selby are skating
together at a roller rink, when a con-
ples’ skate is announced and J oumey’s
“Don’t Stop Believin”’ is played.
Aileen turns to Selby and says, “Oh,
man, I love this song,” as‘they start

skating together. This leads them to .

or faint of heart. It is a violent and inti-

pittnews

mate story, about a troubled woman
who took her pain and turned it on
unsuspecting men. The subject matter
is racy and startling, with a lesbian
love scene and several brutal murder
scenes. With compelling and phenom-
enal performances by Theron and
Ricci, and a well-written script,
“Monster” will leave you startled and
unsettled. You’ll exit the theater satis-
fied with this impressive film.

New Yorkers set  
to face St. J ohn’s

DAVID SHEAROUSE
Staff Writer

When freshman forward Chris
Taft was growing up in New York
City, he wanted to go to Duke. His
friends and teammates, however,
wanted to play for the local basket-
ball power, St. John’s.

“A lot of .kids in New York
wanted to go to St. John’s, but then
things started to change,” Taft said.
“Kids talk about Pitt now. Lots of
New York City players are going to
Pitt, so that’s what the kids are talk-
ing. about.”

Junior forward Mark McCarroll
was one of those kids who wanted
to go to St. John’s.

“I wanted to go St. John’s early

in my high school years,”
McCarroll said. “That was the first
school that recruited me when I was
like a freshman in high school, but
things just didn’t work out. I just
didn’t want to stay home. I wanted a
college life.”

opportunity to play against the Red
Storm tonight at 7 p.m. at the
Petersen Events Center. Taft and
McCarroll hold no hostilities
toward St. John’s; they approach
the game the same as they would
any other regular-season contest.
“It really doesn’t matter [that
the game is against St. John’s],”
Taft said. “This is a Big East game
we’re trying to Win, so we’ve just
got to take it as we take all other
games we want to win.’’ .
While St. John’s (5-13 overall,
0-7 Big East) has won only one of
its last five games, that win came
against former Pitt coach Ben
Howland and UCLA on Saturday, as
the Red Storm defeated the Bruins,
71-55. A
“They’re a very talented team,”

-said Panthers’ head coach Jamie

Dixon. “They got some confidence
going and they can be very danger-
ous. It’s a very dangerous team, and
it just goes to show how talented

_ their players are.”

Elliot leads Pitt with finish in 4x400-meter relay,

MATT EISELE ‘
Staff Writer

The Pitt men’s and women’s indoor track and _

field teams competed in the Penn State National
Open in State College, Pa., this past weekend;
The Lady Panthers placed first in three different
events andfinished in the top five 16 times.
Once again, the Panthers were lead by senior

Trenace Elliot. The national qualifier won the '
400-meter dash with a time of 54.91 seconds and“
led the 4x400 relay team to a second place finish,

with a time of 3:38:34. 1 ‘

Kimberly Lyles, Elizabeth Bayne and Lamey

Stephens also ran well in the 4x400 relay, but the
day belonged to Elliot, who made up almost 20
meters in the fourth leg. A V
“Trena’celvis really starting to become a great
leader‘ forJthis': team,”' said head coach.Alonzo
Webb. “She was a big reason we placed in the

relay; she is really starting to get into a rhythm.” '

Colleen Scott and Tamara McGill also per-
formed well for the Panthers. Scott placed first

in the triple jump, with, a distance of 13.78
meters, and McGill placed first in the pentathlon,

scoring 3,718 points. loelle Ambrose,tJulianna,

Reed and Mycah Clemons also finished third,
fourth and: fifth, -respectively, inthe pentathlon
events.

“The girls are really starting to make a name,
for themselves,” said Webb. “We are trying to

make this an elite program and compete on the
national level on a consistent basis.” »

Amanda Walker, the muscle on the team, had
another solid meet; Sheplaced second in the shot
put, with a throw of 15.38 meters. Walker also
placed fourth in the 20-pound weight throw, with
a toss.-of 17.38 meters. ' _ 4 .

“Amanda is such a competitor that, some-
times, she tries too hard, but shejhas great talent
and is; a big part~of this team’s success,” said
Webb " ’ _

Fatmata Fofonah also placed third in the 60-
meter hurdles for the Panthers with a time of
8.59. A

The men’s team was lead by iJerlyiWilson,l

‘who finished. third in the 800—meter run with a

time of 1:51:18. Mike Stellefson also finished

fifth in the shot putwith a throw of 15.75 meters. 7

“Jerly-ran ,a good race; weare really hoping

“We are starting to land" some top-notch?
recruits — ‘I mean, top 10 recruits,” said Webb. ;
“This program is going places, and I am just.

happy to be part of it.” v
The Panthers were originally supposed to

compete this weekend at the Kent State

Invitational, but Webb decided to enter his team

‘in the State Farm Invitational, hosted by West

Super Bowl should be about the game, notthe festivities

   vs aw

  

 

It’s Monday, ‘ the 2nd of
February. I am sitting up at WPTS-
FM’s main desk doing office hours.
Not surprisingly, the water-cooler
talk surrounds Super Bowl XXXVI-
II. ‘

But my fellow WPTS staffers
and I are not discussing Jake
Delhomme’s 87-yard bomb to
Muhsin Muhammad. Nor are we dis-
cussing Adam Vinatieri’s game-win-'
ning field goal, oreven Tom Brady’s
second Super Bowl MVP award in
three years. A

Our discussion centers around
Janet’s (Ms. Jackson’s, if you’re
nasty) right breast.

And this is exactly why I hate
the Super Bowl.

-don’t believe me,

I love‘ music with a passion,
although I hardly consider P. Diddy
lip-synching his trademark horrible
rhymes for 30 seconds a solid live
outing. I even enjoy making fun of
celebrities from time to time; if you

Houston. And I’ve been a big fan of

Janet Jackson’s breasts for as long .

as I can remember.

But Iikeep my love of sports
separate from those other pleasures.
And the NFL needs to realize who
its core audience is and do the same.

Overithe last decade, the hype
and entertainment dollars surround-
ing the Super Bowl have overshad-
owed the game itself: the champi-
onship ‘football game of the NFL.

Nipplegate 2004 is just the latest

example of the joke the Super Bowl
has become.

First, Super Bowl Sunday
became‘Super Bowl weekend, a cel-
ebration wherein masses of people
could come together, tailgate, and
enjoy themselves before the big
game. Then, it became Super Bowl
week, and the emergence of 24-hour

ask Whitney '

news networks ensured that —we
would be deluged with dumb-jock
cliches and boring press confer-
ences for seven straight days.

This season, after wisely scrap-
ping the system for two years, the
NFL returned to the two-week layoff
after the conference championship
games. This meant twice as many
boring press conferences, Rock ‘n’
Jock Chump contests and stupid

lines coming out of Vegas on they

over-under on how many times Phil
Simms will say “Gosh, golly, geeee-
whiz,” in the first half.

The environment of the game
itself is deplorable. It is always in a
warm city,Vand usually in a dome;
truly horrible conditions for proper
winter football viewing. The major-

ity of the tickets go. to corporations I

for promotional purposes, so instead

of die-hard ‘partisan fans making .

noise, the attendance is mainly
made up of indifferent suits.

More attention is paid to the
halftime show than to the physical

. condition of the field. If you actual-
. ly watched the game on Sunday and

not just the commercials, you might
have noticed that there were several
players losing their footing in the
second half. I’m willing to bet that
this had something to do with the
overblown, Spinal Tap—esque stage

sets that were being wheeled around A

at halftime.

So if you love football, watch
the NFL conference championship
games. They are much more excit-
ing and have far better crowds. If
you love .sports—entertainment,

watch the Super Bowl and, while -

you’re at it, check out Wrestlemania

XX in a couple of months.

And for those of you who
enjoyed Janet and * Tim-bo’s
“wardrobe malfunction” on Sunday,
I’ve got news for you: there was
also a football game being played in
Houston that night.

And it was outstanding.

’ Michael Cunningham is a senior

staff writer for The Pitt News. He
would like to dedicate this column
to the guy who got to hold Janet’s
breasts on the cover of the janet LP.

have a real good scouting report on
us. But we just have to go out there
and play hard and execute every-
thing right.” i 1 .

’ For the season, four players
average 10 points or more for St.
John’s, 1ed‘by Ingram’s average of
13.3 points per game. Senior for-
ward Grady Reynolds averages
about 12 points per contest, while
sophomore guard Daryll Hill con-
tributes ll.3 points per game. Cuffe
averages approximately '10 points
and 6.5 rebounds per outing for the’
Red Storm. .

“[St. John’s] has players that
were heavily recruited and every-
one knows about,” Dixon said.
“Their guards shoot the ball, and
any game that Ingram is making

shots, especially early, really
changes .the whole complexion of

' the game, and that’s what happened

on Saturday.”

In both theAssociated Press and
coaches’ polls released on Monday,
the Panthers (20-1, 6-1) rose to No..
4, their highest ranking of the sea-
son. While Taft is excited about the
ranking, he hopes to get the oppor-
tunity to defend a ranking that is
even higher. c A

“It’s exciting,” Taft said.
“Especially with me. I want to
know how ‘it feels to be ranked No.
2 or ranked No. 1 and just defend-
ing that, and just keep winning, and
with this team, I_ feel like I have
that.”*

The St. 'John’s game will be
televised on Fox Sports Net with
tip-off scheduled for 7 p.m. tonight.

Apartment Prices: Tips on how to bring the price down

Do you have to pay the rental price the
agent or owner gives you? Usually yes, but
not always. Knowing enough to negotiate,
and being able to negotiate intelligently,

can reduce your monthly bill and save you.

a lot of money over the term of the lease.

Buying a car usually means negotiat-
ing for the best price. On the other hand,
we pay supermarket prices without negoti-
ation. Most of us know when to negotiate
and when to pay the listed price, but for
ﬁrst—time renters, intuition may not be a
good guide. You would probably be sur-

’ prised how much pricing ﬂexibility many

rental managers have in-today’s service-
oriented economy. ~

0 Does a manager have the ability to
_ “match” a competitor’s price? Many do,

and will, if you ask and can docu:me’nt'the
lower price.

9 Ask if there is a coupon or discount that
could be applied to the price. Some busi-
nesses offer price reductions for showing a
coupon or discount card, some have dis-
counts for customers referred from busi-

nesses like the “Yellow Pages,” and others‘

give discounts to members of certain
groups, such as senior_citizens and AAA
members. Some Oakland businesses give

card.
0 Will the landlord or agent offer special

services or extra features? If you buy a new ,

computer, you might get free software, or
free assembly may come with the purchase
of a new mountain bike. Can you get can
an extra incentive to rent this apartment?

If you investigate your options and ask

the right questions, you might ﬁnd that

these examples of discounting apply to
renting an apartment, too: .

0 The XYZ Apartments have a similar
apartment for $425 per month. Can you
match ﬂrat price, or can you tell me why
your apartment is worth more than the
XYZ apartment?

- The UVW Apartments will discount my

rent $20 if I pay on time. Can you offer me.

the same discount?

' 0 I like the apartment, but the refrigerator is l

in poor condition. If you provide a new
refrigerator, it’s a deal. I
0 The ABC Apartments oﬁers CMU stu-

dents at pay-for-11-months, 1ive—for-12-"f
.months lease. Is that available for

University of Pittsburgh students‘, too?

Negotiating with a landlord can be as
simple as asking if there is any ﬂexibility in
pricing or if he would accept $25 less per
month. It could entail paying a little more
in order to get what you want, such as a

nine-month lease (instead of 12) in
exchange for an extra $50 per month rent.
You‘ could ask the landlord to furnish the
apartment or put in new bedroom carpets.
It could also mean amending the lease to
allow you to sublet the apartment next
summer when you graduate, or restricting

the landlord’s 24-hour access to the apart-_

ment without advance notice.

Negotiations commonly succeed
when each party - get something it wants in
exchange for giving up something the
other party wants. Landlords are business
people who want a‘ good retum on their
investment, and that means 100 percent
occupancy withtenants who pay their bills
on time, don’t trash the place and don’t
bother the other tenants or neighbors. If
that is the kind of tenant you will be, say
so, then prove it.  will go a long way
toward -helping you. win something you
want from the landlord. If what you want is
a lower price, better lease temrs, cus-
tomized dates of occupancy, or a special
service, you ‘will have to ask for it and
demonstrate that you are the kind of tenant
who will make his life and bottom line bet-
ter.

A common error  negotiation is talk-
ing to the wrong person. You wouldn’t ask
the janitor to lower the rent, because he

couldn’t agree even if he wanted. Make '

sure you are talking with someone who has

the ability to act on your request. Some

rental agents can only show apartments
and list prices. Rental agents may have
some discretion about lease dates and pos-
sibly a rental price range, but they usually
do not. How can you tell if you are talking

to the right person? If she is going to sign

the lease, she is the person who can nego-
tiate the terms.

In the University area, many landlords
expect that if you don’t like the price, the
terms, or the apartment they offer, some-
one else will soon come along who does.
They know that the demand is greater than
the supply, especially if you want to live
within sight of the Cathedral of Leaming.

A They may still negotiate, but you have lit-

tle leverage. But if you can show the land-
lord you know what you are doing and that
you are the kind of tenant who will make
his life better, give it a shot — you have
nothing to lose.

- In all cases, whether negotiated or
taken as offered, you should get every
agreement in writing, signed, and dated.
Memories will fade, good intentions may
falter, and reliability may not be a land-

', lord’s strong suit. But a written document

is proof of the agreement and it is enforce-
able in a court of law. Consider it an insur-
ance policy you hope you’ll never need.

THE PITT NEWS - THE RENTAL GUIDE

Wednesday, February 4, 2004

Know your rights, like the right to quiet and livability

Common sense, a good lease,
and the Pennsylvania Landlord-
Tenant Law protect your tenant
rights. Understanding your legal
rights is a critical advantage that
can help you to avoid, meet, and
overcome rental problems.

Common sense is a personal
attribute requiring consistent exer-
cise. Obtain a receipt for payments
to a landlord or use checks or
money orders that can be verified.
Read and understand anything you
are asked to sign. Get a copy of
anything you sign. An application
to rent is not a lease and is not bind-

ing until confirmed by a lease. If
you pay a security deposit with the
application, .you may lose the
deposit if you decide not to rent the
apartment after you ‘are approved.
Giving notice that you do not wish
to rent the apartment before notifi-
cation of approval should justify
return of the deposit unless specifi-
cally denied by. terms of the appli-
cation or oral notice. An adminis-
trative fee may be charged for a
credit check and would be non-
refundable.

Each party should read, under-
stand, sign and receive a copy of the

lease. The lease is a legal document
describing the relationship, and the
obligations and prohibitions of the
relationship, between the landlord
and the tenant. An oral agreement is
legal, with restrictions, in
Pennsylvania.

The Pennsylvania Landlord-
Tenant Lawis unique, but in some
way similar to those of other states.
You don’t have to be a lawyer to
understand the law, but a lawyer
maybe helpful in asserting your
rights or protecting you from abuse.

Remember that the majority of

landlords are decent, hardworking
)

Want to live in a great
apatnt net year?

business people who desire a posi-
tive relationship with their tenants
and a profit from their rentals. A
minority of landlords create a prob-
lem for some of their tenants.
Resolving problems amicably in
honest discussion is preferable, but
if disagreements are not resolved
easily, additional steps and reme-
dies may be necessary. For minor

‘disagreements, the court is a poor

solution. If the disagreement and/or
the problems are major, the court
may be the only solution. Often,
nonrenewal of the lease is the easi-—
est ending to a bad relationship.

0 Quiet Enjoyment

Quiet enjoyment is the right to
peaceful possession of the property
you leased. The landlord cannot
interfere with your possession and
use of the property byiharassing you
in person or by telephone, or by
entering, or allowing others to
enter, your apartment without rea-

“sonable notice and for legitimate

purpose such as repairs, emergen-
cies, or showing the apartment to
prospective tenants. In addition, the
landlord cannbt withhold utilities or
denyaccess by changing the locks.
If the landlord does these things,
you should advise him or her of
your concerns in writing and in per-
son. If the condition continues, you
may seek court action to prohibit
the action or to terminate the lease
agreement. ‘ "

- Habitability

.Habitability- means the apart-
ment must meet minimal construc-
tion, maintenance, and safety stan-
dards of the municipality having
jurisdiction (usually the City of
Pittsburgh, for students). Adequate

_ hot and cold drinking water, sewage .

and waste disposal, heating, win-
dows, doors, smoke detectors, and
bathrooms are some of the elements

that mustbe provided in residential‘

rentals. Landilordis must repair or
replace those elements and others
when they are broken. The tenant is
responsible for notifying the land-
lord of problems as they occur, and

A the landlord is responsible for mak-

ing repairs. within a reasonable time
of being notified. A landlord’s fail-
ure to make repairs satisfactorily

and within a reasonable time are

two areas that lead to dispute and
could lead to legal action. Notify
your landlord of problems in writ-
ing and keep a record of your
request. Documentation is critical

Rights, page 4
in legal actions.
0 Notice

The landlord must give you
notice if he feels you are violating
your lease, if he wants you to move
out of the apartment before your
lease ends (eviction), or if he plans
to take legal action against you for
violating the lease. Notice allows
you an opportunity to discuss or
correct the problem with the land-
lord, to understand the seriousness
of the problem, and to prepare for
legal action if no amicable agree-
ment is reached. Many leases
include a waiver of notice clause in
this area by which you agree that
the landlord does not have to give
you notice in the situations
described but may take direct legal
action as a first step. This waiver is
legal‘ in Pennsylvania if properly
given in the lease. The waiver saves
the landlord two to three weeks"
time before initiating legal action
against tenants who violate the
lease terms. ‘ R

- Security Deposit

A security deposit is a sum of
money — usually equal to one
month’s rent, but not more than two
months’ rent — given to the land-
lord as pre—payment for any apart-
ment damages or unpaid ‘rent or
fees that occur during the term of
the lease. If there are no charges,
the money must be returned to you
within 30 days of your moving out.
If any money is withheld, the land-
lord must provide you a written
account of what was kept and why.
You must give the landlord a for-
warding address in writing when
you move out to receive your
deposit. (See: Getting Your
Security Deposit Back at right .)

0 Eviction

A landlord may. not evict you
without a valid reason, such as non-
payment of rent. If you refuse to
leave, the landlord must begin legal
action, and if the court agrees with
the landlord, it will orderyou to

i leave. If you still refuse, the police

can physically remove you and
your belongings. The landlord may
not lock you out or turn off water or
heat in order to force you to leave.
(See: “Are You Threatened with
Eviction?” on the HRC Web site.)

Gettingyour security
deposit back; talking is key

Your landlord must return your
deposit and/or provide you written
notice of__ any charges within 30 days
of your moving out. If he or she does
not, you may seek recovery of your
deposit and a penalty equal to the
amount of the deposit through the
courts (district magistrate or housing
court). A '

To recover your security deposit

you should:

0 Return your keys by the date your
lease ends.

0 Provide your forwarding address in
writing. ‘

.- Remove all personal belongings.

- Clean the apartment.

0 Dispose of all trash properly.

0 Follow any special cleaning instruc-
tions in thelease. '

0 Inspect the apartment with the land-
lord, if possible. .

If you owe the landlord any rent
(deposits may not be used as the last

‘month’s rent), fees, utility assess-

ments, or repair charges, the landlord

may deduct those charges from your .

deposit and bill you if there is an out-

standing balance. The landlord must

identify the detailed charges in writ-
ing within 30 days. If you disagree
with the charges, discuss them with
the landlord. Document in writing

your disagreement and any compro- -

mise, adjustment, or agreement
reached with the landlord. If no agree-
ment is reached, your last alternative
for a landlord who does not honor his
or her obligations under the law is
legal action. Your refusal to pay
charges for repairs or unpaid bills that
exceed your security deposit will usu-
ally result in legal action by the land-

lord. '

Security deposits are a- normal
element of apartment rental. The
Pennsylvania Landlord-Tenant Act
specifies how deposits are to be
received, maintained, applied, and
returned or kept by the landlord.
Knowing your rights and meeting
your obligations under the lease
agreement are your‘ best guarantees of
recovering your deposit. Legal action
is not the first alternative, but it may
be necessary if your landlord does not
honor his or her obligations under the
law.

Subletting: what to do and
how to do it with less hassle

Ins and Outs of Subletting

To sublet (sublease) is to lease to

I another person a house or apartment that is

already being leased to you. In legal terms,
tl1e landlord is the lessor, the tenant is the
lessee, and the sublessee is renting from the
lessee.

Assignment is an alternative to sublet-
ting in which the sublessee assumes the
remainder of ﬂue original lease and deals
with the landlord directly. In lease assign-
ment, the‘ original lessee remains ﬁnancial-
ly responsible for rental payments and/or
damage charges if the sublessee defaults.
Novation is the term 'for a landlord voiding

' your original lease and entering into a new

lease with a new tenant. In novation, you

would recover your security deposit——pro—

viding there is no chargeable damage —‘—
and have no further legal or ﬁnancial oblig-
ation to the landlord. 4' I '

sublet? If so, what steps or procedures must
you follow? Are you  to notify your
landlord in writing of your intention or to
have the landlord approve any prospective
sublessees? If your lease does not say any-
thing about sublets, it is generally assumed
that you can sublet I

Meet With your landlord. Discuss your
intentions, gain written approval, and clari-
fy the process with your landlord. Wﬂl the

landlord permit you to terminate your lease '
~ without penalty if you locate someone to

assume your lease or accept a new lease?

This is usually preferable for students. If
you plan to return to the apartment after a

‘ short time (one to six months) or before

your lease expires, it might be better to sub-
let and maintain your claim on the apart-
ment for your return. If fhC landlord allows
subletting, or if ﬂie lease doesn’t prohibit

subletting, it is the landlord’s option ‘

whether to allow assignment or novation. g
‘ If you sublet your apartment, realize
that you are, for all intents and purposes, a

_ landlord! You will need to establish, collect,

document, and account for a security
deposit. A deposit is necessary to protect

yourself, but it imposes legal obligations on’

you just as it does for your landlord. You
should have a lease agreement, in writing,
to protectyourself from any problems or
legal actions brought by your tenant An
oral agreement is binding in Pennsylvania

but is subject to misunderstanding and
challenges in court. In a sublet, you will still

be responsible for paying rent, and if your

tenant is supposed to pay your landlord

directly (in either sublet or assignment),

you are responsible for any missing or short
payments and/or late fees. You will be
responsible for any damages to the unit and
may be responsible for unpaid utility bills,
telephone charges, and cable TV. fees.
Leasing and security deposit forms and
explanations are ,avajlable, on the Internet,

at public and ‘university libraries, and in ,

bookstores. .
Realize that the actions of your tenant
may also affect you. Tenant damage to the
unit, building, common areas, or systems,
may result in legal action against you to
collect damages. legal action may also be_

required for you to collect damages from '

your sublessee. Unintentional damage to

 the..unit or building, such as aﬁre or ﬂood,

may make the unit uninhabitable. Who is
responsible for paying damage costs and
related tenant expenses?

The Housing Resource Center recom-

mends that, whenever possible, students -

terminate their lease with their landlord,
have the sublessee sign a new lease with the
landlord, recover their security deposit, and
have no further legal obligations or liability
to the landlord or the new tenant.

Looking for a Sublet Apartment ' A

For all intents and purposes, subletting
and leasing are identical. You arethe lessee

and should be familiar With the require- 1

ments and standards of both lessors, but
that is only slightly more complicated than
a traditional lease agreement. The advan-
tages of subletting are that ‘you may be able
to sign a lease shorter than 12 months and
you may be able to pay a discounted rental
rate. In most rental communities and uni-
versity student housing areas, leases are for
12 months. If you only need ‘an apartment

for one term or during the summer, a sublet

can be ideal. Even if the landlord becomes
your lessor, the length of the lease can be

negotiated for the duration of the original ,

lease term, if you wish. While the rental
rate agreed to by the landlord and original
tenant is customary for the sublet, it may be
possible to negotiate a discount from the
tenant Remember, if the unit is not sublet,
the original tenant is responsiblefor paying
the entire rent for the remainder of the lease
term. This can be a signiﬁcant incentive to
negotiate. ’

Subletting an wartment is a legal rela-

tionship. Know your rights and obligations. T

Document your discussions and all agree-
ments. Be a knowledgeable consumer, a
good tenant, and an informed landlord. To
list a sublet or to check available sublets,

THE PITT NEWS - THE RENTAL GUIDE

A Wednesday, February 4, 2004

All you’ve ever wanted to know about leases, and then some

The Housing Resource Center provides this information
to help students understand the parts, meaning and irr1plica—
tions of apartment leases used by area landlords. An attorney
did not prepare this information, and you should not consid-
er it legal advice. The information and opinions presented are
those of the staff of HRC, who are solely responsible for any
errors or omissions. Any questions about your legal rights as
a tenant or possible legal action should be discussed with an
attorney.

Leases Are Contracts

Leases spell out the relationship and requirements for
both the tenant and landlord Because the landlord chooses
what the lease will say, it usually favors the landlord. If the
tenant disagrees with some part of the ‘lease, it should be dis-
cussed and may be modiﬁed or deleted by mutual agree-
ment Any change, addition or deletion to the contract should
be initialed by both the landlord and the tenant(s). Noﬂring
said or agreed to orally will change any part of the lease
unless it is in writing and signed by both parties. The court
will use only the written lease to decide any legal action
brought before it. Ifyou do not agree to the terms of the entire

_ document, do not sign it. Your signature will bind you to ful-

ﬁll the terms of the agreement exactly as it is written and/or
pay signiﬁcant ﬁnancial penalties. There are no timeouts,
second chances or fresh starts. Landlords will use the courts
or threat of legal action to enforce the lease, and tenants
should be equally prepared to exercise their rights under the
contract and through the courts if necessary. Everyone who
signs the lease should receive a copy, with signatures, to
serve as a record of the lease and each party’s responsibilities
under the temrs of the lease. ’

A lease is a contract between you and the landlord It

describes a legal agreement in which you are given posses-
sion of an apartment, owned by the landlord, in which to live
for a speciﬁc length «of time. The lease also speciﬁes what
you are to do (and not do) in order to receive or retain pos-
session of the apartment

Contracts can be long or short, simple or complex.
Contracts can be oral, but normally are in writing in order to
be enforced Enforcing a contract generally means asking a

‘court for a judgment that would force one or both parties to

do — or not do —— what the contract speciﬁes. Legal actions
to enforce a lease are usually brought to the district magis-
trate but could be brought to another court, depending upon
what is being charged or what relief is being sought.

Signatures
Leases must be signed by both parties. They do not have

to be witnessed, although landlords may choose to have a

staff member formally witness the signature. In
Pemrsylvania, you must be over 18 to legally sign a contract.
If you are under 18, the landlord may require a co—signer,
such as your parent, who will accept legal responsibility for
the obligations of the lease for/with you. In the University
area, many landlords will request/require a parent to co-sign
even if you are over 18. This is an acceptable business prac-
tice, although it may armoy the strident Since students gen-
erally have limited personal assets, the landlord will be able
to take legal action against the co-signer in case the student

breaches/defaults on the lease. Legal action for breaching a .

lease can be taken across state lines.
Identify the Property

Leases should identify the property to be rented

symptoms start, you may be eligible to participate
V in a research study in the North Pittsburgh area.

Identiﬁcation should include the street address and apartment
number. Students should inspect the speciﬁc apartment they
are renting before they sign the lease. If, when you are ready
to move in, the apartment you leased is not ready for occu-
pancy, you may agree to take a diiferent unit. However, you
are not obligated to accept any apartment other than the one
identiﬁed in the lease. Of course, if the station wagon is
parked outside, and classes begin on Monday, you will be
under signiﬁcant pressure to accept an alternate apartment
from the landlord, who may be apologetic and accommo-
dating. V

Altemately, the apartment you rented might be trashed
from the last occupants, and the landlord won’t be able to
clean it before you are supposed to move in. You can accept
an altemate,'wait in a hotel until your apartment is ready, or
move into the mess. Ifyou do move in, take pictures or video
the damages anddeﬁciencies, ﬁll out a thorough inspection
report for the landlord with a list of repairs and cleaning that
needs to be done, and remind the landlord regularly of the

work remaining to be completed until the apartment is ﬁilly ‘

ready for occupancy. While most landlords take pride in the
appearance and standards of their apartments, some make a

habit of procrastinating and then cleaning or ﬁxing just -
enough, knowing that many students will eventually give up p A

on a leaking toilet, dirty reﬁigerator, or torn carpet
Length of the Lease

Leases should indicate the starting date and ending date
of occupancy. Most leases in the University area are for 12
months. In some cases, the lease may be open,-ended or
month—to—month. Leases of six, nine and 10 months are occa-

sionally found in this area, but are unusual.
Many leases are pre-printed or pub-
lished fomis on which the‘landlord ﬁlls in the
blanks before both parties sign The publish-
ing company or professional association pro-
viding the forms will be printed on the bot-
tom of the page. Pre—printed forms usually
contain the basic legal elements of a good
lease, and newer ones are written in plain
language, a requirement in Pemisylvania.

Rules and Regulations

Watch for rules and regulations that may
be included in the lease or attached as an
additional document These may be regula-
tions about noise, cleaning requirements and
standards, garbage storage and disposal,
security issues, smoke detectors, parties,
guests, pets, parking, hallways, lights, land-
lord access to inspect or show the apartment
to prospective tenants, and other lifestyle
issues. Rules and regulations are often a
problem between landlord and tenant if they
are not understood, agreed to, and followed.
Tenants can be evicted for breaching the
lease by not following these rules. Rules and
regulations can be changed, added to -or
amended by the landlord during the lease,

without tenant approval, if the lease allows it. ‘

Security deposits are customary in the
University community. They are usually
equal to one or two months’ rent. They can-
not be greater than two months’ rent. Most
leases specify that the deposit carmot be used
as the last month’s rent. Some leases’ say ﬂrat
if the landlord uses some or all of the securi-
ty deposit during the tenn "of the lease, ﬂue
tenant must pay to bring the deposit up to the
lease-speciﬁed amount The landlord must
place the security deposit‘  an escrow
account in a bank for the term of the lease, or
may be bonded, which is a guarantee of pay-
ment. The tenant does not receive any inter-
est payments from the escrow deposit for the
ﬁrst or second year. On longer leases, inter-
est must be paid after the second year.

Payment of Rent ,

Payments of rent, also called considera-
tion, are speciﬁed in the lease. Payment
information will include the monthly rent
amount, the total amount of the rent to be
paid over the term of the lease (usually 12
times the monthly rent), when (date due) and
where (oﬁice address) the rent is to be paid,

how the rent is to be paid, (mail, in person,"

check, money order, etc.), and a‘ late date
after which ﬂte payment is not on time and
violates the lease terms. Some landlords

’ 1 allow a discount for timely payment. (e.g.

rent is $500 a month, but if paid before the

www.pride-realty.com

 

ﬁfth of the month, a discount of $50 will be
allowed -—— therefore, the rent due is $450.)
Other landlords assess a penalty if the rent is
late (e.g., rent is $500 a monﬂi, but if paid
after the ﬁfth of the month, a penalty of $50
will be charged — therefore, the rent due
will be $550) Both ways are acceptable;
however, the total amount of the contract,
which is usually stated in the lease, will be
changed depending on whether it is dis-
counted or penalized. If discounted, the total
contract amount will not reﬂect the discount

but will be the full/larger amount. In event of .

a lawsuit by the landlord, the landlord would
request payment in full for the entire lease
term, which would be the larger amount.

Utilities and Appliances

Utilities‘ and appliances are also
described in the lease, and these details
should be read carefully. Who pays which
utilities should be speciﬁcally indicated If
the tenant is responsible for certain utilities,
they must contract directly with the utility
company. Utilities provided by theelandlord

should be listed Utilities include electricity, .

water and sewage, and_ may include gas and
garbage removal. Be . cautious about agree-
ing to pay ﬂie landlord for utility services
based upon the landlord’s contract with the
utility company. While not illegal, it is a sit-
uation that could tempt an unscrupulous
landlord to inﬂate charges, double-bill ten-

ants, or charge -tenants for services the ten-
ants did not use. Utility conrpanies will pro-
vide estimates of service charges for tenants
if requested and will perform usage audits
for customers who Wish to verify charges.
Usually, a refrigerator and stove are included
if the rental unit has a kitchen, and should be
referenced in the lease. Other appliances are
not usually provided. A dishwasher, garbage
disposal, or Window "air conditioner would
be listed if included

Use and Occupancy

Many leases will include a use and
occupancy section that indicates the‘ use of
the apartment is limited to residential and
dictates the number of people who may live
there. This means it carmot be used for busi-
ness, nor to house more persons than stated
in the lease. Children in a family are count-
ed, as are unrelated adults. Guests may also
be restricted by language in this section or in

rules ‘and regulations. The allowance of P

ovemight, guests or visitors, the maximum
number of nights they can stay, and if they
can be given a key to the apartment are com-
mon lirnits on the tenant’s use of the apart-
ment. -

Lease, page 12

Sublets and assignments will permit, prohibit, or deﬁne
the landlord’s policy on subletting or assigning the lease to
another person. If the- lease does not prohibit it, state law per-
mits subletting. Watch for the need for written permission by
the landlord to sublet or assign, and/or additional fees or

- penalties that will be charged for subletting. If you do not

plan to remain in Pittsburgh or to attend the University dur-
ing the summer, subletting is a reasonable altemative to pay-
ing for an apartment you aren’t using. Guest and visitor poli-
cies might prohibit allowing someone touse your apartment
for the summer without the landlord’s knowledge or permis-
sion.
Acceleration of Rent

The landlord may have the option of an acceleration of
rent if the tenant fails to pay rent on time or breaches/violates
other lease terms. This means the landlord can demand the
entire amount of the lease consideration be paid within 30
days. This is usually a last resort for the landlord who isn’t
receiving the rent in regular, timely, or complete payments,
although it could be sought for other violations of the lease.
Unless the tenant agrees and pays the amount speciﬁed in the
lease on time, the landlord will go to court to receive a judg-
ment ordering the payment. A clause in the lease will usual-
ly specify the availability of that option for the landlord.

Waiver of Notices

Some leases now include a waiver of notices. Normally,

notice will be given to the tenant prior to the termination date
of the lease. Waiving this notice has little impact on the ten-
ant, who should be aware of the end of the lease and the need
to renew or move out Tenants should be aware of any penal-.
ties for failing to move out by die end date of the lease. Often,
high daily rates or an entire month’s rent are speciﬁed for
holdovers. -

Waiver of another notice normally required of the land-
lord could be more damaging to the tenant. If a landlord ini-
tiates legal action to force a tenant to pay outstanding rent
payments or to leave the property, the law requires the land-
lord to give written notice of the action to the tenant. This
notice allows the tenant time to correct the problem or nego-
tiate with the landlord. By waiving the right of notice, the ten-
ant will be deprived of the opportunities to correct the prob-
lem and the landlord will immediately ﬁle legal’ action.’

Confession of Judgment

Some leases may contain a confession of judgment
clause, which is a liability for the tenant and which, when
combined with a waiver of notice, is legally terminal. In a
confession of judgment, the tenant agrees, by signing the
lease, to allow any attorney, including the landlord’s attorney,
to represent him and to confess judgment or essentially
“plead guilty” for the tenant. Having pled guilty, the‘ tenant
will be responsible for whatever judgment is handed down.
Confession of is a very serious and controversial

V remedythatappearstobeatoddswiththeAmericanconcept

of due process. As a result, confession of judgment clauses

- require speciﬁc wording, information, and acknowledgment

in the lease to make them enforceable. This might be the only

grounds for appeal for a tenant. who suddenly is ordered to
leave the premises, pay the entire cost of the lease, or both,
as well as court costs and attomey’s fees.

Right of Entry
Many landlords in the University area will specify a

right of entry in the lease. Usually this means that the 1and— ’

lord can enter the apartment, without notice and whether or
not the tenant is present, in order to ﬁx something that the
tenant has requested, to respond to an emergency, or to show
the apartment to prospective tenants. Any limits on the time
of day, purpose, or notice will be speciﬁed here. leases that
allow landlord access for any reason and at any time of the
day or night should be questioned. Failure to allow the land-
lord access could be grounds for the landlord to take legal
action if the lease speciﬁes access. Tenants are entitled to the
right of quiet possession, but elements of that rigln can be
abridged by lease. ' ’

Renewal

Renewal is the term for extending the current lease
agreement for another ‘period of time. Usirally, a one-year
lease renews for anoﬂrer year and a six—montl1s lease for
another six months, although some leases will renew on a
month-to—month basis after the  lease term. In the
University area, many landlords now require the tenant to

renew their lease as much as ﬁve months or 150 days before
the end of the lease. This permits them to advertise vacancies

THE PITT NEWS - THE RENTAL GUIDE A 15

Renter ’,s   Insurance: What

is it, and do you need it?  

The staff of the Housing Resource
Center suggeststhat you purchase insurance
to protect your property and your guests.

Renter’s insurance is a good idea

I whether you have nice fumiture andlots of

expensive stuff, or are living with second-
hand furniture and rnilk—crate tables. Most
students have more to lose than they can
alford to replace. In case of ﬁre or theft, they
are often surprised by the high cost of replac-
ing the TV, stereo, computer, books, clothes,

sporting goods, bicycle,- jewelry, eyeglasses, —

CDs, and other items usually taken for grant-
ed. .

Renter’s insurance handles three types
of problems:

.- Personal Property Protection covers the
loss of your personal property due to ﬁre,
theft, water damage, smoke, etc. The value
of the policy ($3,000; $5,000; $l0,0()0, etc.)
sets the limit of your compensation for dam-
ages. You determine the amount of coverage
you want, and the premium or cost of the
policy is set accordingly. The greater the
coverage, the more you are eligible to collect
and the higher ﬂie premium you will pay.
With this type of coverage, if your $200 CD
player is 5 years old, you are only be able to
collect the depreciated value of the machine,
not the actual cost of a replacement

’ - Replacement Coverage covers the actual

replacement cost of damaged property.‘ It
covers the actual cost to replace damaged
items, as long as the cost doesn’t exceed the

total policy value. Replacement. coverage is ’

more expensive than traditional property
protection. If you have high—quality or
expensive possessions, consider buying

replacement coverage. If you don’t, regular

coverage will probably be adequate. With
either type of coverage, having proof of
ownership and the purchase price of major
items is recommended. A videotape of your
apartment will help to show ownership, and

either credit card or store receipts will estab-. .

lish the value of the items.

- Personal Liability is the third type of pro-
tection provided by renter’s insurance. If a
guest, visitor, or service worker is injured
while in or around your apartment, regard-
less of whose fault it is, his or her medical
expenses will be covered by your policy.

This is important protection in case of injury
to friends or relatives who might be reluctant
to sue you for damages, as well as protection
for you if strangers are  Your insur-
ance coverage provides payment for their
documented medical or property expenses

arising out of an accident in or around your

apartment. For instance, if you were at fault
for leaving objects blocking the stairway,
your insurance would pay damages and

defend you against legal action. If the land- .

lord were responsible for not ﬁxing the
handrail, for example, your insurance com-
pany would pay damages and then collect
damages from the landlord or his insurance
company. If the injured person were at fault,
your insurance company would either deny
his claim for damages or pay and then sue
for recovery from the individual or his insur-
ance company.

. The cost of renter’s insurance is fairly
low, only $75 to $250 per year for a policy
that provides reasonable coverage for the
average strident Adiscount may be available
iftheinsuranceispurchasedfromthe same
company that provides your automobile
insurance or your parents’ homeowner’s pol-
icy. Students may even be covered by their
parents’ homeowner’s policy. Increasing or
decreasing the po1icy’s deductible value —
essentially ﬂre threshold of damages for
which thejnsurance company will pay -
will raise or lower the cost of coverage. It
pays to shop for renter’s insurance, but most
reputable insurance companies provide
comparable coverage at competitive prices.

Do you need to have renter’s insurance?

Be sure to read your lease carefully. A num- .

ber of landlords who rent to students include
a “waiver of liability” clause in which they
deny any responsibility for a tenant’s belong-
ings or for injury to guests or visitors. They

may also stipulate that the tenant must pur- j

chase renter’s insurance as a condition of
occupancy. If these clauses are included in
your lease, and you do not purchase renter’s
insurance, you will be personally responsi-
ble for the costs of property damage or loss,
personal injury liability, and legal expenses
in connection with those events, and you
may be unable to collect damages from your
landlord, even if he or she is partially respon-
sible. If your lease stipulates that you pur-
chase renter’s insurance, you must purchase
it. ~ ‘

Visitors plus rness equals ugh

Lease, page 14

for the next academic year prior to_the end of
the spring term. This is a good move for the
landlord, but it could be awkward for the stu-
dent who isn’t sure about staying in the
apartment another year or even returning to

school the next year. A Very early renewal
deadline also means that the spring term can
be a series of landlord visits with prospective
renters touring your humble abode. While
not generally as picky about neatness as
morn, visitors checking out your closet and
bathroom can quickly become an ordeal.

Make your parents happy. Rent from a landlord who is TENANT FRIENDLY
